<simpara>Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of
the common patterns in distributed systems (e.g. configuration
management, service discovery, circuit breakers, intelligent routing,
micro-proxy, control bus). Coordination of
distributed systems leads to boiler plate patterns, and using Spring
Cloud developers can quickly stand up services and applications that
implement those patterns. They will work well in any distributed
environment, including the developer&#8217;s own laptop, bare metal data
centres, and managed platforms such as Cloud Foundry.</simpara>

<title>Cloud Native Applications</title>
<partintro>
<simpara><link xl:href="https://pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/migrating-to-cloud-native-application-architectures-ebook">Cloud Native</link> is a style of application development that encourages easy adoption of best practices in the areas of continuous delivery and value-driven development.
A related discipline is that of building <link xl:href="https://12factor.net/">12-factor Applications</link>, in which development practices are aligned with delivery and operations goals&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for instance, by using declarative programming and management and monitoring.
Spring Cloud facilitates these styles of development in a number of specific ways.
 The starting point is a set of features to which all components in a distributed system need easy access.</simpara>
<simpara>Many of those features are covered by <link xl:href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot">Spring Boot</link>, on which Spring Cloud builds. Some more features are delivered by Spring Cloud as two libraries: Spring Cloud Context and Spring Cloud Commons.
Spring Cloud Context provides utilities and special services for the <literal>ApplicationContext</literal> of a Spring Cloud application (bootstrap context, encryption, refresh scope, and environment endpoints). Spring Cloud Commons is a set of abstractions and common classes used in different Spring Cloud implementations (such as Spring Cloud Netflix and Spring Cloud Consul).</simpara>
<simpara>If you get an exception due to "Illegal key size" and you use Sun&#8217;s JDK, you need to install the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files.

<chapter xml:id="_spring_cloud_context_application_context_services">
<title>Spring Cloud Context: Application Context Services</title>
<simpara>Spring Boot has an opinionated view of how to build an application with Spring.
For instance, it has conventional locations for common configuration files and has endpoints for common management and monitoring tasks.
Spring Cloud builds on top of that and adds a few features that probably all components in a system would use or occasionally need.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_the_bootstrap_application_context">
<title>The Bootstrap Application Context</title>
<simpara>A Spring Cloud application operates by creating a <quote>bootstrap</quote> context, which is a parent context for the main application.
It is responsible for loading configuration properties from the external sources and for decrypting properties in the local external configuration files.
The two contexts share an <literal>Environment</literal>, which is the source of external properties for any Spring application.
By default, bootstrap properties (not <literal>bootstrap.properties</literal> but properties that are loaded during the bootstrap phase) are added with high precedence, so they cannot be overridden by local configuration.</simpara>
<simpara>The bootstrap context uses a different convention for locating external configuration than the main application context.
Instead of <literal>application.yml</literal> (or <literal>.properties</literal>), you can use <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal>, keeping the external configuration for bootstrap and main context
nicely separate.
The following listing shows an example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>bootstrap.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>spring:
  application:
    name: foo
  cloud:
    config:
      uri: ${SPRING_CONFIG_URI:http://localhost:8888}</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>If your application needs any application-specific configuration from the server, it is a good idea to set the <literal>spring.application.name</literal> (in <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal> or <literal>application.yml</literal>).
In order for the property <literal>spring.application.name</literal> to be used as the application&#8217;s context ID you
must set it in <literal>bootstrap.[properties | yml]</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>You can disable the bootstrap process completely by setting <literal>spring.cloud.bootstrap.enabled=false</literal> (for example, in system properties).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_application_context_hierarchies">
<title>Application Context Hierarchies</title>
<simpara>If you build an application context from <literal>SpringApplication</literal> or <literal>SpringApplicationBuilder</literal>, then the Bootstrap context is added as a parent to that context.
It is a feature of Spring that child contexts inherit property sources and profiles from their parent, so the <quote>main</quote> application context contains additional property sources, compared to building the same context without Spring Cloud Config.
The additional property sources are:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><quote>bootstrap</quote>: If any <literal>PropertySourceLocators</literal> are found in the Bootstrap context and if they have non-empty properties, an optional <literal>CompositePropertySource</literal> appears with high priority.
An example would be properties from the Spring Cloud Config Server.
See <quote><xref linkend="customizing-bootstrap-property-sources"/></quote> for instructions on how to customize the contents of this property source.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><quote>applicationConfig: [classpath:bootstrap.yml]</quote> (and related files if Spring profiles are active): If you have a <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal> (or <literal>.properties</literal>), those properties are used to configure the Bootstrap context.
Then they get added to the child context when its parent is set.
They have lower precedence than the <literal>application.yml</literal> (or <literal>.properties</literal>) and any other property sources that are added to the child as a normal part of the process of creating a Spring Boot application.
See <quote><xref linkend="customizing-bootstrap-properties"/></quote> for instructions on how to customize the contents of these property sources.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Because of the ordering rules of property sources, the <quote>bootstrap</quote> entries take precedence.
However, note that these do not contain any data from <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal>, which has very low precedence but can be used to set defaults.</simpara>
<simpara>You can extend the context hierarchy by setting the parent context of any <literal>ApplicationContext</literal> you create&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for example, by using its own interface or with the <literal>SpringApplicationBuilder</literal> convenience methods (<literal>parent()</literal>, <literal>child()</literal> and <literal>sibling()</literal>).
The bootstrap context is the parent of the most senior ancestor that you create yourself.
Every context in the hierarchy has its own <quote>bootstrap</quote> (possibly empty) property source to avoid promoting values inadvertently from parents down to their descendants.
If there is a Config Server, every context in the hierarchy can also (in principle) have a different <literal>spring.application.name</literal> and, hence, a different remote property source.
Normal Spring application context behavior rules apply to property resolution: properties from a child context override those in
the parent, by name and also by property source name.
(If the child has a property source with the same name as the parent, the value from the parent is not included in the child).</simpara>
<simpara>Note that the <literal>SpringApplicationBuilder</literal> lets you share an <literal>Environment</literal> amongst the whole hierarchy, but that is not the default.
Thus, sibling contexts, in particular, do not need to have the same profiles or property sources, even though they may share common values with their parent.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="customizing-bootstrap-properties">
<title>Changing the Location of Bootstrap Properties</title>
<simpara>The <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal> (or <literal>.properties</literal>) location can be specified by setting <literal>spring.cloud.bootstrap.name</literal> (default: <literal>bootstrap</literal>) or <literal>spring.cloud.bootstrap.location</literal> (default: empty)&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for example, in System properties.
Those properties behave like the <literal>spring.config.*</literal> variants with the same name.
In fact, they are used to set up the bootstrap <literal>ApplicationContext</literal> by setting those properties in its <literal>Environment</literal>.
If there is an active profile (from <literal>spring.profiles.active</literal> or through the <literal>Environment</literal> API in the
context you are building), properties in that profile get loaded as well, the same as in a regular Spring Boot app&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for example, from <literal>bootstrap-development.properties</literal> for a <literal>development</literal> profile.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="overriding-bootstrap-properties">
<title>Overriding the Values of Remote Properties</title>
<simpara>The property sources that are added to your application by the bootstrap context are often <quote>remote</quote> (from example, from Spring Cloud Config Server).
By default, they cannot be overridden locally.
If you want to let your applications override the remote properties with their own System properties or config files, the remote property source has to grant it permission by setting <literal>spring.cloud.config.allowOverride=true</literal> (it does not work to set this locally).
Once that flag is set, two finer-grained settings control the location of the remote properties in relation to system properties and the application&#8217;s local configuration:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>spring.cloud.config.overrideNone=true</literal>: Override from any local property source.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>spring.cloud.config.overrideSystemProperties=false</literal>: Only system properties, command line arguments, and environment variables (but not the local config files) should override the remote settings.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>
<section xml:id="_customizing_the_bootstrap_configuration">
<title>Customizing the Bootstrap Configuration</title>
<simpara>The bootstrap context can be set to do anything you like by adding entries to <literal>/META-INF/spring.factories</literal> under a key named <literal>org.springframework.cloud.bootstrap.BootstrapConfiguration</literal>.
This holds a comma-separated list of Spring <literal>@Configuration</literal> classes that are used to create the context.
Any beans that you want to be available to the main application context for autowiring can be created here.
There is a special contract for <literal>@Beans</literal> of type <literal>ApplicationContextInitializer</literal>.
If you want to control the startup sequence, classes can be marked with an <literal>@Order</literal> annotation (the default order is <literal>last</literal>).</simpara>
<warning>
<simpara>When adding custom <literal>BootstrapConfiguration</literal>, be careful that the classes you add are not <literal>@ComponentScanned</literal> by mistake into your <quote>main</quote> application context, where they might not be needed.
Use a separate package name for boot configuration classes and make sure that name is not already covered by your <literal>@ComponentScan</literal> or <literal>@SpringBootApplication</literal> annotated configuration classes.</simpara>
</warning>
<simpara>The bootstrap process ends by injecting initializers into the main <literal>SpringApplication</literal> instance (which is the normal Spring Boot startup sequence, whether it is running as a standalone application or deployed in an application server).
First, a bootstrap context is created from the classes found in <literal>spring.factories</literal>.
Then, all <literal>@Beans</literal> of type <literal>ApplicationContextInitializer</literal> are added to the main <literal>SpringApplication</literal> before it is started.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="customizing-bootstrap-property-sources">
<title>Customizing the Bootstrap Property Sources</title>
<simpara>The default property source for external configuration added by the bootstrap process is the Spring Cloud Config Server, but you can add additional sources by adding beans of type <literal>PropertySourceLocator</literal> to the bootstrap context (through <literal>spring.factories</literal>).
For instance, you can insert additional properties from a different server or from a database.</simpara>
<simpara>As an example, consider the following custom locator:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Configuration
public class CustomPropertySourceLocator implements PropertySourceLocator {

    @Override
    public PropertySource&lt;?&gt; locate(Environment environment) {
        return new MapPropertySource("customProperty",
                Collections.&lt;String, Object&gt;singletonMap("property.from.sample.custom.source", "worked as intended"));
    }

}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>Environment</literal> that is passed in is the one for the <literal>ApplicationContext</literal> about to be created&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;in other words, the one for which we supply additional property sources for.
It already has its normal Spring Boot-provided property sources, so you can use those to locate a property source specific to this <literal>Environment</literal> (for example, by keying it on <literal>spring.application.name</literal>, as is done in the default Spring Cloud Config Server property source locator).</simpara>
<simpara>If you create a jar with this class in it and then add a <literal>META-INF/spring.factories</literal> containing the following, the <literal>customProperty</literal> <literal>PropertySource</literal> appears in any application that includes that jar on its classpath:</simpara>
<screen>org.springframework.cloud.bootstrap.BootstrapConfiguration=sample.custom.CustomPropertySourceLocator</screen>
</section>
<section xml:id="_logging_configuration">
<title>Logging Configuration</title>
<simpara>If you are going to use Spring Boot to configure log settings than
you should place this configuration in `bootstrap.[yml | properties]
if you would like it to apply to all events.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>For Spring Cloud to initialize logging configuration properly you cannot use a custom prefix.  For example,
using <literal>custom.loggin.logpath</literal> will not be recognized by Spring Cloud when initializing the logging system.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_environment_changes">
<title>Environment Changes</title>
<simpara>The application listens for an <literal>EnvironmentChangeEvent</literal> and reacts to the change in a couple of standard ways (additional <literal>ApplicationListeners</literal> can be added as <literal>@Beans</literal> by the user in the normal way).
When an <literal>EnvironmentChangeEvent</literal> is observed, it has a list of key values that have changed, and the application uses those to:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Re-bind any <literal>@ConfigurationProperties</literal> beans in the context</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Set the logger levels for any properties in <literal>logging.level.*</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Note that the Config Client does not, by default, poll for changes in the <literal>Environment</literal>.
Generally, we would not recommend that approach for detecting changes (although you could set it up with a
<literal>@Scheduled</literal> annotation).
If you have a scaled-out client application, it is better to broadcast the <literal>EnvironmentChangeEvent</literal> to all the instances instead of having them polling for changes (for example, by using the <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-bus">Spring Cloud Bus</link>).</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>EnvironmentChangeEvent</literal> covers a large class of refresh use cases, as long as you can actually make a change to the <literal>Environment</literal> and publish the event.
Note that those APIs are public and part of core Spring).
You can verify that the changes are bound to <literal>@ConfigurationProperties</literal> beans by visiting the <literal>/configprops</literal> endpoint (a normal Spring Boot Actuator feature).
For instance, a <literal>DataSource</literal> can have its <literal>maxPoolSize</literal> changed at runtime (the default <literal>DataSource</literal> created by Spring Boot is an <literal>@ConfigurationProperties</literal> bean) and grow capacity dynamically.
Re-binding <literal>@ConfigurationProperties</literal> does not cover another large class of use cases, where you need more control over the refresh and where you need a change to be atomic over the whole <literal>ApplicationContext</literal>.
To address those concerns, we have <literal>@RefreshScope</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="refresh-scope">
<title>Refresh Scope</title>
<simpara>When there is a configuration change, a Spring <literal>@Bean</literal> that is marked as <literal>@RefreshScope</literal> gets special treatment.
This feature addresses the problem of stateful beans that only get their configuration injected when they are initialized.
For instance, if a <literal>DataSource</literal> has open connections when the database URL is changed via the <literal>Environment</literal>, you probably want the holders of those connections to be able to complete what they are doing.
Then, the next time something borrows a connection from the pool, it gets one with the new URL.</simpara>
<simpara>Sometimes, it might even be mandatory to apply the <literal>@RefreshScope</literal>
annotation on some beans which can be only initialized once. If a bean
is "immutable", you will have to either annotate the bean with <literal>@RefreshScope</literal>
or specify the classname under the property key
<literal>spring.cloud.refresh.extra-refreshable</literal>.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>If you create a <literal>DataSource</literal> bean yourself and the implementation is a <literal>HikariDataSource</literal>, return the
most specific type, in this case <literal>HikariDataSource</literal>. Otherwise, you will need to set
<literal>spring.cloud.refresh.extra-refreshable=javax.sql.DataSource</literal>.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>Refresh scope beans are lazy proxies that initialize when they are used (that is, when a method is called), and the scope acts as a cache of initialized values.
To force a bean to re-initialize on the next method call, you must invalidate its cache entry.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>RefreshScope</literal> is a bean in the context and has a public  <literal>refreshAll()</literal> method to refresh all beans in the scope by clearing the target cache.
The <literal>/refresh</literal> endpoint exposes this functionality (over HTTP or JMX).
To refresh an individual bean by name, there is also a <literal>refresh(String)</literal> method.</simpara>
<simpara>To expose the <literal>/refresh</literal> endpoint, you need to add following configuration to your application:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: refresh</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara><literal>@RefreshScope</literal> works (technically) on an <literal>@Configuration</literal> class, but it might lead to surprising behavior.
For example, it does not mean that all the <literal>@Beans</literal> defined in that class are themselves in <literal>@RefreshScope</literal>.
Specifically, anything that depends on those beans cannot rely on them being updated when a refresh is initiated, unless it is itself in <literal>@RefreshScope</literal>.
In that case, it is rebuilt on a refresh and its dependencies are re-injected. At that point, they are re-initialized from the refreshed <literal>@Configuration</literal>).</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_encryption_and_decryption">
<title>Encryption and Decryption</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud has an <literal>Environment</literal> pre-processor for decrypting property values locally.
It follows the same rules as the Config Server and has the same external configuration through <literal>encrypt.*</literal>.
Thus, you can use encrypted values in the form of <literal>{cipher}*</literal> and, as long as there is a valid key, they are decrypted before the main application context gets the <literal>Environment</literal> settings.
To use the encryption features in an application, you need to include Spring Security RSA in your classpath (Maven co-ordinates: "org.springframework.security:spring-security-rsa"), and you also need the full strength JCE extensions in your JVM.</simpara>
<simpara>If you get an exception due to "Illegal key size" and you use Sun&#8217;s JDK, you need to install the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files.

<title>Spring Cloud Commons: Common Abstractions</title>
<simpara>Patterns such as service discovery, load balancing, and circuit breakers lend themselves to a common abstraction layer that can be consumed by all Spring Cloud clients, independent of the implementation (for example, discovery with Eureka or Consul).</simpara>
<section xml:id="_enablediscoveryclient">
<title>@EnableDiscoveryClient</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Commons provides the <literal>@EnableDiscoveryClient</literal> annotation.
This looks for implementations of the <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> interface with <literal>META-INF/spring.factories</literal>.
Implementations of the Discovery Client add a configuration class to <literal>spring.factories</literal> under the <literal>org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient</literal> key.
Examples of <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> implementations include <link xl:href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/">Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka</link>, <link xl:href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-consul/">Spring Cloud Consul Discovery</link>, and <link xl:href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-zookeeper/">Spring Cloud Zookeeper Discovery</link>.</simpara>

<title>Service Registry Actuator Endpoint</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Commons provides a <literal>/service-registry</literal> actuator endpoint.
This endpoint relies on a <literal>Registration</literal> bean in the Spring Application Context.
Calling <literal>/service-registry</literal> with GET returns the status of the <literal>Registration</literal>.
Using POST to the same endpoint with a JSON body changes the status of the current <literal>Registration</literal> to the new value.
The JSON body has to include the <literal>status</literal> field with the preferred value.
Please see the documentation of the <literal>ServiceRegistry</literal> implementation you use for the allowed values when updating the status and the values returned for the status.
For instance, Eureka&#8217;s supported statuses are <literal>UP</literal>, <literal>DOWN</literal>, <literal>OUT_OF_SERVICE</literal>, and <literal>UNKNOWN</literal>.</simpara>

<title>Spring RestTemplate as a Load Balancer Client</title>
<simpara><literal>RestTemplate</literal> can be automatically configured to use a Load-balancer client under the hood.
To create a load-balanced <literal>RestTemplate</literal>, create a <literal>RestTemplate</literal> <literal>@Bean</literal> and use the <literal>@LoadBalanced</literal> qualifier, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Configuration

<caution>
<simpara>A <literal>RestTemplate</literal> bean is no longer created through auto-configuration.

<important>
<simpara>In order to use a load-balanced <literal>RestTemplate</literal>, you need to have a load-balancer implementation in your classpath.
The recommended implementation is <literal>BlockingLoadBalancerClient</literal>
- add <literal>org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-loadbalancer</literal> in order to use it.
The

<title>Spring Cloud Config</title>
<partintro>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Greenwich.SR4</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Config provides server-side and client-side support for externalized configuration in a distributed system. With the Config Server, you have a central place to manage external properties for applications across all environments.
The concepts on both client and server map identically to the Spring <literal>Environment</literal> and <literal>PropertySource</literal> abstractions, so they fit very well with Spring applications but can be used with any application running in any language.
As an application moves through the deployment pipeline from dev to test and into production, you can manage the configuration between those environments and be certain that applications have everything they need to run when they migrate.
The default implementation of the server storage backend uses git, so it easily supports labelled versions of configuration environments as well as being accessible to a wide range of tooling for managing the content.
It is easy to add alternative implementations and plug them in with Spring configuration.</simpara>
</partintro>
<chapter xml:id="_quick_start">
<title>Quick Start</title>
<simpara>This quick start walks through using both the server and the client of Spring Cloud Config Server.</simpara>
<simpara>First, start the server, as follows:</simpara>
<screen>$ cd spring-cloud-config-server
$ ../mvnw spring-boot:run</screen>
<simpara>The server is a Spring Boot application, so you can run it from your IDE if you prefer to do so (the main class is <literal>ConfigServerApplication</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>Next try out a client, as follows:</simpara>
<screen>$ curl localhost:8888/foo/development
{"name":"foo","label":"master","propertySources":[
  {"name":"https://github.com/scratches/config-repo/foo-development.properties","source":{"bar":"spam"}},
  {"name":"https://github.com/scratches/config-repo/foo.properties","source":{"foo":"bar"}}
]}</screen>
<simpara>The default strategy for locating property sources is to clone a git repository (at <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri</literal>) and use it to initialize a mini <literal>SpringApplication</literal>.
The mini-application&#8217;s <literal>Environment</literal> is used to enumerate property sources and publish them at a JSON endpoint.</simpara>
<simpara>The HTTP service has resources in the following form:</simpara>
<screen>/{application}/{profile}[/{label}]
/{application}-{profile}.yml
/{label}/{application}-{profile}.yml
/{application}-{profile}.properties
/{label}/{application}-{profile}.properties</screen>
<simpara>where <literal>application</literal> is injected as the <literal>spring.config.name</literal> in the <literal>SpringApplication</literal> (what is normally <literal>application</literal> in a regular Spring Boot app), <literal>profile</literal> is an active profile (or comma-separated list of properties), and <literal>label</literal> is an optional git label (defaults to <literal>master</literal>.)</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Config Server pulls configuration for remote clients from various sources. The following example gets configuration from a git repository (which must be provided), as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo</programlisting>
<simpara>Other sources are any JDBC compatible database, Subversion, Hashicorp Vault, Credhub and local filesystems.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_client_side_usage">
<title>Client Side Usage</title>
<simpara>To use these features in an application, you can build it as a Spring Boot application that depends on spring-cloud-config-client (for an example, see the test cases for the config-client or the sample application).
The most convenient way to add the dependency is with a Spring Boot starter <literal>org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-config</literal>.
There is also a parent pom and BOM (<literal>spring-cloud-starter-parent</literal>) for Maven users and a Spring IO version management properties file for Gradle and Spring CLI users. The following example shows a typical Maven configuration:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>pom.xml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">   &lt;parent&gt;
       &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
       &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-parent&lt;/artifactId&gt;
       &lt;version&gt;{spring-boot-docs-version}&lt;/version&gt;
       &lt;relativePath /&gt; &lt;!-- lookup parent from repository --&gt;
   &lt;/parent&gt;

&lt;dependencyManagement&gt;
	&lt;dependencies&gt;
		&lt;dependency&gt;
			&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;

			&lt;version&gt;{spring-cloud-version}&lt;/version&gt;

</formalpara>
<simpara>Now you can create a standard Spring Boot application, such as the following HTTP server:</simpara>
<screen>@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class Application {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

}</screen>
<simpara>When this HTTP server runs, it picks up the external configuration from the default local config server (if it is running) on port 8888.
To modify the startup behavior, you can change the location of the config server by using <literal>bootstrap.properties</literal> (similar to <literal>application.properties</literal> but for the bootstrap phase of an application context), as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.config.uri: http://myconfigserver.com</screen>
<simpara>By default, if no application name is set, <literal>application</literal> will be used. To modify the name, the following property can be added to the <literal>bootstrap.properties</literal> file:</simpara>
<screen>spring.application.name: myapp</screen>
<note>
<simpara>When setting the property <literal>${spring.application.name}</literal> do not prefix your app name with the reserved word <literal>application-</literal> to prevent issues resolving the correct property source.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>The bootstrap properties show up in the <literal>/env</literal> endpoint as a high-priority property source, as shown in the following example.</simpara>
<screen>$ curl localhost:8080/env
{
  "profiles":[],
  "configService:https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo/bar.properties":{"foo":"bar"},
  "servletContextInitParams":{},
  "systemProperties":{...},
  ...
}</screen>
<simpara>A property source called <literal>``configService:&lt;URL of remote repository&gt;/&lt;file name&gt;</literal> contains the <literal>foo</literal> property with a value of <literal>bar</literal> and is highest priority.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The URL in the property source name is the git repository, not the config server URL.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_spring_cloud_config_server">
<title>Spring Cloud Config Server</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Config Server provides an HTTP resource-based API for external configuration (name-value pairs or equivalent YAML content).
The server is embeddable in a Spring Boot application, by using the <literal>@EnableConfigServer</literal> annotation.
Consequently, the following application is a config server:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>ConfigServer.java</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@EnableConfigServer
public class ConfigServer {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(ConfigServer.class, args);
  }
}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Like all Spring Boot applications, it runs on port 8080 by default, but you can switch it to the more conventional port 8888 in various ways.
The easiest, which also sets a default configuration repository, is by launching it with <literal>spring.config.name=configserver</literal> (there is a <literal>configserver.yml</literal> in the Config Server jar).
Another is to use your own <literal>application.properties</literal>, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.properties</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="properties" linenumbering="unnumbered">server.port: 8888
spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri: file://${user.home}/config-repo</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>where <literal>${user.home}/config-repo</literal> is a git repository containing YAML and properties files.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>On Windows, you need an extra "/" in the file URL if it is absolute with a drive prefix (for example,<literal><link xl:href="file:///${user.home}/config-repo">file:///${user.home}/config-repo</link></literal>).</simpara>
</note>
<tip>
<simpara>The following listing shows a recipe for creating the git repository in the preceding example:</simpara>
<screen>$ cd $HOME
$ mkdir config-repo
$ cd config-repo
$ git init .
$ echo info.foo: bar &gt; application.properties
$ git add -A .
$ git commit -m "Add application.properties"</screen>
</tip>
<warning>
<simpara>Using the local filesystem for your git repository is intended for testing only.
You should use a server to host your configuration repositories in production.</simpara>
</warning>
<warning>
<simpara>The initial clone of your configuration repository can be quick and efficient if you keep only text files in it.
If you store binary files, especially large ones, you may experience delays on the first request for configuration or encounter out of memory errors in the server.</simpara>
</warning>
<section xml:id="_environment_repository">
<title>Environment Repository</title>
<simpara>Where should you store the configuration data for the Config Server?
The strategy that governs this behaviour is the <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal>, serving <literal>Environment</literal> objects.
This <literal>Environment</literal> is a shallow copy of the domain from the Spring <literal>Environment</literal> (including <literal>propertySources</literal> as the main feature).
The <literal>Environment</literal> resources are parametrized by three variables:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>{application}</literal>, which maps to <literal>spring.application.name</literal> on the client side.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>{profile}</literal>, which maps to <literal>spring.profiles.active</literal> on the client (comma-separated list).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>{label}</literal>, which is a server side feature labelling a "versioned" set of config files.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Repository implementations generally behave like a Spring Boot application, loading configuration files from a <literal>spring.config.name</literal> equal to the <literal>{application}</literal> parameter, and <literal>spring.profiles.active</literal> equal to the <literal>{profiles}</literal> parameter.
Precedence rules for profiles are also the same as in a regular Spring Boot application: Active profiles take precedence over defaults, and, if there are multiple profiles, the last one wins (similar to adding entries to a <literal>Map</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>The following sample client application has this bootstrap configuration:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>bootstrap.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  application:
    name: foo
  profiles:
    active: dev,mysql</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>(As usual with a Spring Boot application, these properties could also be set by environment variables or command line arguments).</simpara>
<simpara>If the repository is file-based, the server creates an
<literal>Environment</literal> from <literal>application.yml</literal> (shared between all clients) and
<literal>foo.yml</literal> (with <literal>foo.yml</literal> taking precedence).
If the YAML files have documents inside them that point to Spring profiles, those are applied with higher precedence (in order of the profiles listed).
If there are profile-specific YAML (or properties) files, these are also applied with higher precedence than the defaults.
Higher precedence translates to a <literal>PropertySource</literal> listed earlier in the <literal>Environment</literal>.
(These same rules apply in a standalone Spring Boot application.)</simpara>
<simpara>You can set spring.cloud.config.server.accept-empty to false so that Server would return a HTTP 404 status, if the application is not found.By default, this flag is set to true.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_git_backend">
<title>Git Backend</title>
<simpara>The default implementation of <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> uses a Git backend, which is very convenient for managing upgrades and physical environments and for auditing changes.
To change the location of the repository, you can set the <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri</literal> configuration property in the Config Server (for example in <literal>application.yml</literal>).
If you set it with a <literal>file:</literal> prefix, it should work from a local repository so that you can get started quickly and easily without a server. However, in that case, the server operates directly on the local repository without cloning it (it does not matter if it is not bare because the Config Server never makes changes to the "remote" repository).
To scale the Config Server up and make it highly available, you need to have all instances of the server pointing to the same repository, so only a shared file system would work.
Even in that case, it is better to use the <literal>ssh:</literal> protocol for a shared filesystem repository, so that the server can clone it and use a local working copy as a cache.</simpara>
<simpara>This repository implementation maps the <literal>{label}</literal> parameter of the HTTP resource to a git label (commit id, branch name, or tag).
If the git branch or tag name contains a slash (<literal>/</literal>), then the label in the HTTP URL should instead be specified with the special string <literal>(_)</literal> (to avoid ambiguity with other URL paths).
For example, if the label is <literal>foo/bar</literal>, replacing the slash would result in the following label: <literal>foo(_)bar</literal>.
The inclusion of the special string <literal>(_)</literal> can also be applied to the <literal>{application}</literal> parameter.
If you use a command-line client such as curl, be careful with the brackets in the URL&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;you should escape them from the shell with single quotes ('').</simpara>
<section xml:id="_skipping_ssl_certificate_validation">
<title>Skipping SSL Certificate Validation</title>
<simpara>The configuration server&#8217;s validation of the Git server&#8217;s SSL certificate can be disabled by setting the <literal>git.skipSslValidation</literal> property to <literal>true</literal> (default is <literal>false</literal>).</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:

</section>
<section xml:id="_setting_http_connection_timeout">
<title>Setting HTTP Connection Timeout</title>
<simpara>You can configure the time, in seconds, that the configuration server will wait to acquire an HTTP connection. Use the <literal>git.timeout</literal> property.</simpara>

</section>
<section xml:id="_placeholders_in_git_uri">
<title>Placeholders in Git URI</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Config Server supports a git repository URL with placeholders for the <literal>{application}</literal> and <literal>{profile}</literal> (and <literal>{label}</literal> if you need it, but remember that the label is applied as a git label anyway).
So you can support a <quote>one repository per application</quote> policy by using a structure similar to the following:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/myorg/{application}</programlisting>
<simpara>You can also support a <quote>one repository per profile</quote> policy by using a similar pattern but with
<literal>{profile}</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Additionally, using the special string "(_)" within your <literal>{application}</literal> parameters can enable support for multiple
organizations, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/{application}</programlisting>
<simpara>where <literal>{application}</literal> is provided at request time in the following format: <literal>organization(_)application</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_pattern_matching_and_multiple_repositories">
<title>Pattern Matching and Multiple Repositories</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Config also includes support for more complex requirements with pattern
matching on the application and profile name.
The pattern format is a comma-separated list of <literal>{application}/{profile}</literal> names with wildcards (note that a pattern beginning with a wildcard may need to be quoted), as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          repos:
            simple: https://github.com/simple/config-repo
            special:
              pattern: special*/dev*,*special*/dev*
              uri: https://github.com/special/config-repo
            local:
              pattern: local*
              uri: file:/home/configsvc/config-repo</programlisting>
<simpara>If <literal>{application}/{profile}</literal> does not match any of the patterns, it uses the default URI defined under <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri</literal>.
In the above example, for the <quote>simple</quote> repository, the pattern is <literal>simple/*</literal> (it only matches one application named <literal>simple</literal> in all profiles). The <quote>local</quote> repository matches all application names beginning with <literal>local</literal> in all profiles (the <literal>/*</literal> suffix is added automatically to any pattern that does not have a profile matcher).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The <quote>one-liner</quote> short cut used in the <quote>simple</quote> example can be used only if the only property to be set is the URI.
If you need to set anything else (credentials, pattern, and so on) you need to use the full form.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>The <literal>pattern</literal> property in the repo is actually an array, so you can use a YAML array (or <literal>[0]</literal>, <literal>[1]</literal>, etc. suffixes in properties files) to bind to multiple patterns.
You may need to do so if you are going to run apps with multiple profiles, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          repos:
            development:
              pattern:
                - '*/development'
                - '*/staging'
              uri: https://github.com/development/config-repo
            staging:
              pattern:
                - '*/qa'
                - '*/production'
              uri: https://github.com/staging/config-repo</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>Spring Cloud guesses that a pattern containing a profile that does not end in <literal>*</literal> implies that you actually want to match a list of profiles starting with this pattern (so <literal>*/staging</literal> is a shortcut for <literal>["*/staging", "*/staging,*"]</literal>, and so on).
This is common where, for instance, you need to run applications in the <quote>development</quote> profile locally but also the <quote>cloud</quote> profile remotely.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Every repository can also optionally store config files in sub-directories, and patterns to search for those directories can be specified as <literal>searchPaths</literal>.
The following example shows a config file at the top level:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          searchPaths: foo,bar*</programlisting>
<simpara>In the preceding example, the server searches for config files in the top level and in the <literal>foo/</literal> sub-directory and also any sub-directory whose name begins with <literal>bar</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>By default, the server clones remote repositories when configuration
is first requested.
The server can be configured to clone the repositories at startup, as shown in the following top-level example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://git/common/config-repo.git
          repos:
            team-a:
                pattern: team-a-*
                cloneOnStart: true
                uri: https://git/team-a/config-repo.git
            team-b:
                pattern: team-b-*
                cloneOnStart: false
                uri: https://git/team-b/config-repo.git
            team-c:
                pattern: team-c-*
                uri: https://git/team-a/config-repo.git</programlisting>
<simpara>In the preceding example, the server clones team-a&#8217;s config-repo on startup, before it
accepts any requests.
All other repositories are not cloned until configuration from the repository is requested.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Setting a repository to be cloned when the Config Server starts up can help to identify a misconfigured configuration source (such as an invalid repository URI) quickly, while the Config Server is starting up.
With <literal>cloneOnStart</literal> not enabled for a configuration source, the Config Server may start successfully with a misconfigured or invalid configuration source and not detect an error until an application requests configuration from that configuration source.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_authentication">
<title>Authentication</title>
<simpara>To use HTTP basic authentication on the remote repository, add the <literal>username</literal> and <literal>password</literal> properties separately (not in the URL), as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          username: trolley
          password: strongpassword</programlisting>
<simpara>If you do not use HTTPS and user credentials, SSH should also work out of the box when you store keys in the default directories (<literal>~/.ssh</literal>) and the URI points to an SSH location, such as <literal>git@github.com:configuration/cloud-configuration</literal>.
It is important that an entry for the Git server be present in the <literal>~/.ssh/known_hosts</literal> file and that it is in <literal>ssh-rsa</literal> format.
Other formats (such as <literal>ecdsa-sha2-nistp256</literal>) are not supported.
To avoid surprises, you should ensure that only one entry is present in the <literal>known_hosts</literal> file for the Git server and that it matches the URL you provided to the config server.
If you use a hostname in the URL, you want to have exactly that (not the IP) in the <literal>known_hosts</literal> file.
The repository is accessed by using JGit, so any documentation you find on that should be applicable.
HTTPS proxy settings can be set in <literal>~/.git/config</literal> or (in the same way as for any other JVM process) with
system properties (<literal>-Dhttps.proxyHost</literal> and <literal>-Dhttps.proxyPort</literal>).</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>If you do not know where your <literal>~/.git</literal> directory is, use <literal>git config --global</literal> to manipulate the settings (for example, <literal>git config --global http.sslVerify false</literal>).</simpara>
</tip>
</section>
<section xml:id="_authentication_with_aws_codecommit">
<title>Authentication with AWS CodeCommit</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Config Server also supports <link xl:href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/welcome.html">AWS CodeCommit</link> authentication.
AWS CodeCommit uses an authentication helper when using Git from the command line.
This helper is not used with the JGit library, so a JGit CredentialProvider for AWS CodeCommit is created if the Git URI matches the AWS CodeCommit pattern.
AWS CodeCommit URIs follow this pattern://git-codecommit.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/${repopath}.</simpara>
<simpara>If you provide a username and password with an AWS CodeCommit URI, they must be the <link xl:href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSGettingStartedGuide/AWSCredentials.html">AWS accessKeyId and secretAccessKey</link> that provide access to the repository.
If you do not specify a username and password, the accessKeyId and secretAccessKey are retrieved by using the <link xl:href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html">AWS Default Credential Provider Chain</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>If your Git URI matches the CodeCommit URI pattern (shown earlier), you must provide valid AWS credentials in the username and password or in one of the locations supported by the default credential provider chain.
AWS EC2 instances may use <link xl:href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html">IAM Roles for EC2 Instances</link>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The <literal>aws-java-sdk-core</literal> jar is an optional dependency.
If the <literal>aws-java-sdk-core</literal> jar is not on your classpath, the AWS Code Commit credential provider is not created, regardless of the git server URI.</simpara>
</note>

<section xml:id="_git_ssh_configuration_using_properties">
<title>Git SSH configuration using properties</title>
<simpara>By default, the JGit library used by Spring Cloud Config Server uses SSH configuration files such as <literal>~/.ssh/known_hosts</literal> and <literal>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</literal> when connecting to Git repositories by using an SSH URI.
In cloud environments such as Cloud Foundry, the local filesystem may be ephemeral or not easily accessible.
For those cases, SSH configuration can be set by using Java properties.
In order to activate property-based SSH configuration, the <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.git.ignoreLocalSshSettings</literal> property must be set to <literal>true</literal>, as shown in the following example:</simpara>

<title>Placeholders in Git Search Paths</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Config Server also supports a search path with placeholders for the <literal>{application}</literal> and <literal>{profile}</literal> (and <literal>{label}</literal> if
you need it), as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:

        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          searchPaths: '{application}'</programlisting>
<simpara>The preceding listing causes a search of the repository for files in the same name as the directory (as well as the top level).
Wildcards are also valid in a search path with placeholders (any matching directory is included in the search).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_force_pull_in_git_repositories">
<title>Force pull in Git Repositories</title>
<simpara>As mentioned earlier, Spring Cloud Config Server makes a clone of the remote git repository in case the local copy gets dirty (for example,
folder content changes by an OS process) such that Spring Cloud Config Server cannot update the local copy from remote repository.</simpara>
<simpara>To solve this issue, there is a <literal>force-pull</literal> property that makes Spring Cloud Config Server force pull from the remote repository if the local copy is dirty, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:

<simpara>If you have a multiple-repositories configuration, you can configure the <literal>force-pull</literal> property per repository, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:

<section xml:id="_deleting_untracked_branches_in_git_repositories">
<title>Deleting untracked branches in Git Repositories</title>
<simpara>As Spring Cloud Config Server has a clone of the remote git repository
after check-outing branch to local repo (e.g fetching properties by label) it will keep this branch
forever or till the next server restart (which creates new local repo).
So there could be a case when remote branch is deleted but local copy of it is still available for fetching.
And if Spring Cloud Config Server client service starts with <literal>--spring.cloud.config.label=deletedRemoteBranch,master</literal>
it will fetch properties from <literal>deletedRemoteBranch</literal> local branch, but not from <literal>master</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>In order to keep local repository branches clean and up to remote - <literal>deleteUntrackedBranches</literal> property could be set.
It will make Spring Cloud Config Server <emphasis role="strong">force</emphasis> delete untracked branches from local repository.
Example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          deleteUntrackedBranches: true</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>The default value for <literal>deleteUntrackedBranches</literal> property is <literal>false</literal>.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_git_refresh_rate">
<title>Git Refresh Rate</title>
<simpara>You can control how often the config server will fetch updated configuration data
from your Git backend by using <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.git.refreshRate</literal>.  The
value of this property is specified in seconds.  By default the value is 0, meaning
the config server will fetch updated configuration from the Git repo every time it
is requested.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="_version_control_backend_filesystem_use">
<title>Version Control Backend Filesystem Use</title>
<warning>
<simpara>With VCS-based backends (git, svn), files are checked out or cloned to the local filesystem.
By default, they are put in the system temporary directory with a prefix of <literal>config-repo-</literal>.
On linux, for example, it could be <literal>/tmp/config-repo-&lt;randomid&gt;</literal>.
Some operating systems <link xl:href="https://serverfault.com/questions/377348/when-does-tmp-get-cleared/377349#377349">routinely clean out</link> temporary directories.
This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as missing properties.
To avoid this problem, change the directory that Config Server uses by setting <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.git.basedir</literal> or <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.svn.basedir</literal> to a directory that does not reside in the system temp structure.</simpara>
</warning>
</section>
<section xml:id="_file_system_backend">
<title>File System Backend</title>
<simpara>There is also a <quote>native</quote> profile in the Config Server that does not use Git but loads the config files from the local classpath or file system (any static URL you want to point to with <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.native.searchLocations</literal>).
To use the native profile, launch the Config Server with <literal>spring.profiles.active=native</literal>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Remember to use the <literal>file:</literal> prefix for file resources (the default without a prefix is usually the classpath).
As with any Spring Boot configuration, you can embed <literal>${}</literal>-style environment placeholders, but remember that absolute paths in Windows require an extra <literal>/</literal> (for example, <literal><link xl:href="file:///${user.home}/config-repo">file:///${user.home}/config-repo</link></literal>).</simpara>
</note>
<warning>
<simpara>The default value of the <literal>searchLocations</literal> is identical to a local Spring Boot application (that is, <literal>[classpath:/, classpath:/config,
file:./, file:./config]</literal>).
This does not expose the <literal>application.properties</literal> from the server to all clients, because any property sources present in the server are removed before being sent to the client.</simpara>
</warning>
<tip>
<simpara>A filesystem backend is great for getting started quickly and for testing.
To use it in production, you need to be sure that the file system is reliable and shared across all instances of the Config Server.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>The search locations can contain placeholders for <literal>{application}</literal>, <literal>{profile}</literal>, and <literal>{label}</literal>.
In this way, you can segregate the directories in the path and choose a strategy that makes sense for you (such as subdirectory per application or subdirectory per profile).</simpara>
<simpara>If you do not use placeholders in the search locations, this repository also appends the <literal>{label}</literal> parameter of the HTTP resource to a suffix on the search path, so properties files are loaded from each search location <emphasis role="strong">and</emphasis> a subdirectory with the same name as the label (the labelled properties take precedence in the Spring Environment).
Thus, the default behaviour with no placeholders is the same as adding a search location ending with <literal>/{label}/</literal>.
For example, <literal>file:/tmp/config</literal> is the same as <literal>file:/tmp/config,file:/tmp/config/{label}</literal>.
This behavior can be disabled by setting <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.native.addLabelLocations=false</literal>.</simpara>

<section xml:id="vault-backend">
<title>Vault Backend</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Config Server also supports <link xl:href="https://www.vaultproject.io">Vault</link> as a backend.</simpara>
<sidebar>
<simpara>Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets.
A secret is anything that to which you want to tightly control access, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and other sensitive information. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.</simpara>
</sidebar>
<simpara>For more information on Vault, see the <link xl:href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/?track=getting-started#getting-started">Vault quick start guide</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>To enable the config server to use a Vault backend, you can run your config server with the <literal>vault</literal> profile.
For example, in your config server&#8217;s <literal>application.properties</literal>, you can add <literal>spring.profiles.active=vault</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>By default, the config server assumes that your Vault server runs at <literal><link xl:href="http://127.0.0.1:8200">http://127.0.0.1:8200</link></literal>.
It also assumes that the name of backend is <literal>secret</literal> and the key is <literal>application</literal>.
All of these defaults can be configured in your config server&#8217;s <literal>application.properties</literal>.
The following table describes configurable Vault properties:</simpara>

<simpara>All of the properties in the preceding table must be prefixed with <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.vault</literal> or placed in the correct Vault section of a composite configuration.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>All configurable properties can be found in <literal>org.springframework.cloud.config.server.environment.VaultEnvironmentProperties</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Vault 0.10.0 introduced a versioned key-value backend (k/v backend version 2) that exposes a different API than earlier versions, it now requires a <literal>data/</literal> between the mount path and the actual context path and wraps secrets in a <literal>data</literal> object. Setting <literal>kvVersion=2</literal> will take this into account.</simpara>
<simpara>Optionally, there is support for the Vault Enterprise <literal>X-Vault-Namespace</literal> header. To have it sent to Vault set the <literal>namespace</literal> property.</simpara>
<simpara>With your config server running, you can make HTTP requests to the server to retrieve
values from the Vault backend.
To do so, you need a token for your Vault server.</simpara>
<simpara>First, place some data in you Vault, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="sh" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ vault kv put secret/application foo=bar baz=bam
$ vault kv put secret/myapp foo=myappsbar</programlisting>
<simpara>Second, make an HTTP request to your config server to retrieve the values, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<simpara><literal>$ curl -X "GET" "http://localhost:8888/myapp/default" -H "X-Config-Token: yourtoken"</literal></simpara>
<simpara>You should see a response similar to the following:</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
   "name":"myapp",

      }
   ]
}</programlisting>
<section xml:id="_multiple_properties_sources">
<title>Multiple Properties Sources</title>
<simpara>When using Vault, you can provide your applications with multiple properties sources.
For example, assume you have written data to the following paths in Vault:</simpara>

secret/myApp
secret/application,dev
secret/application</programlisting>
<simpara>Properties written to <literal>secret/application</literal> are available to <link linkend="_vault_server">all applications using the Config Server</link>.
An application with the name, <literal>myApp</literal>, would have any properties written to <literal>secret/myApp</literal> and <literal>secret/application</literal> available to it.
When <literal>myApp</literal> has the <literal>dev</literal> profile enabled, properties written to all of the above paths would be available to it, with properties in the first path in the list taking priority over the others.</simpara>

<title>JDBC Backend</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Config Server supports JDBC (relational database) as a backend for configuration properties.
You can enable this feature by adding <literal>spring-jdbc</literal> to the classpath and using the <literal>jdbc</literal> profile or by adding a bean of type <literal>JdbcEnvironmentRepository</literal>.
If you include the right dependencies on the classpath (see the user guide for more details on that), Spring Boot configures a data source.</simpara>
<simpara>The database needs to have a table called <literal>PROPERTIES</literal> with columns called <literal>APPLICATION</literal>, <literal>PROFILE</literal>, and <literal>LABEL</literal> (with the usual <literal>Environment</literal> meaning), plus <literal>KEY</literal> and <literal>VALUE</literal> for the key and value pairs in <literal>Properties</literal> style.

<section xml:id="composite-environment-repositories">
<title>Composite Environment Repositories</title>
<simpara>In some scenarios, you may wish to pull configuration data from multiple environment repositories.
To do so, you can enable the <literal>composite</literal> profile in your configuration server&#8217;s application properties or YAML file.
If, for example, you want to pull configuration data from a Subversion repository as well as two Git repositories, you can set the following properties for your configuration server:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  profiles:
    active: composite
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        composite:
        -
          type: svn
          uri: file:///path/to/svn/repo
        -
          type: git
          uri: file:///path/to/rex/git/repo
        -
          type: git
          uri: file:///path/to/walter/git/repo</programlisting>
<simpara>Using this configuration, precedence is determined by the order in which repositories are listed under the <literal>composite</literal> key.
In the above example, the Subversion repository is listed first, so a value found in the Subversion repository will override values found for the same property in one of the Git repositories.
A value found in the <literal>rex</literal> Git repository will be used before a value found for the same property in the <literal>walter</literal> Git repository.</simpara>
<simpara>If you want to pull configuration data only from repositories that are each of distinct types, you can enable the corresponding profiles, rather than the <literal>composite</literal> profile, in your configuration server&#8217;s application properties or YAML file.
If, for example, you want to pull configuration data from a single Git repository and a single HashiCorp Vault server, you can set the following properties for your configuration server:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  profiles:
    active: git, vault
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: file:///path/to/git/repo
          order: 2
        vault:
          host: 127.0.0.1
          port: 8200
          order: 1</programlisting>
<simpara>Using this configuration, precedence can be determined by an <literal>order</literal> property.
You can use the <literal>order</literal> property to specify the priority order for all your repositories.
The lower the numerical value of the <literal>order</literal> property, the higher priority it has.
The priority order of a repository helps resolve any potential conflicts between repositories that contain values for the same properties.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>If your composite environment includes a Vault server as in the previous example, you must include a Vault token in every request made to the configuration server. See <link linkend="vault-backend">Vault Backend</link>.</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>Any type of failure when retrieving values from an environment repository results in a failure for the entire composite environment.</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>When using a composite environment, it is important that all repositories contain the same labels.
If you have an environment similar to those in the preceding examples and you request configuration data with the <literal>master</literal> label but the Subversion repository does not contain a branch called <literal>master</literal>, the entire request fails.</simpara>
</note>
<section xml:id="_custom_composite_environment_repositories">
<title>Custom Composite Environment Repositories</title>
<simpara>In addition to using one of the environment repositories from Spring Cloud, you can also provide your own <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> bean to be included as part of a composite environment.
To do so, your bean must implement the <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> interface.
If you want to control the priority of your custom <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> within the composite environment, you should also implement the <literal>Ordered</literal> interface and override the <literal>getOrdered</literal> method.
If you do not implement the <literal>Ordered</literal> interface, your <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> is given the lowest priority.</simpara>

</section>
<section xml:id="_property_overrides">
<title>Property Overrides</title>
<simpara>The Config Server has an <quote>overrides</quote> feature that lets the operator provide configuration properties to all applications.
The overridden properties cannot be accidentally changed by the application with the normal Spring Boot hooks.
To declare overrides, add a map of name-value pairs to <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.overrides</literal>, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        overrides:
          foo: bar</programlisting>
<simpara>The preceding examples causes all applications that are config clients to read <literal>foo=bar</literal>, independent of their own configuration.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>A configuration system cannot force an application to use configuration data in any particular way.
Consequently, overrides are not enforceable.
However, they do provide useful default behavior for Spring Cloud Config clients.</simpara>
</note>
<tip>
<simpara>Normally, Spring environment placeholders with <literal>${}</literal> can be escaped (and resolved on the client) by using backslash (<literal>\</literal>) to escape the <literal>$</literal> or the <literal>{</literal>.
For example, <literal>\${app.foo:bar}</literal> resolves to <literal>bar</literal>, unless the app provides its own <literal>app.foo</literal>.</simpara>
</tip>
<note>
<simpara>In YAML, you do not need to escape the backslash itself.
However, in properties files, you do need to escape the backslash, when you configure the overrides on the server.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>You can change the priority of all overrides in the client to be more like default values, letting applications supply their own values in environment variables or System properties, by setting the  <literal>spring.cloud.config.overrideNone=true</literal> flag (the default is false) in the remote repository.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="_health_indicator_2">
<title>Health Indicator</title>
<simpara>Config Server comes with a Health Indicator that checks whether the configured <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> is working.
By default, it asks the <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> for an application named <literal>app</literal>, the <literal>default</literal> profile, and the default label provided by the <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> implementation.</simpara>
<simpara>You can configure the Health Indicator to check more applications along with custom profiles and custom labels, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        health:
          repositories:
            myservice:
              label: mylabel
            myservice-dev:
              name: myservice
              profiles: development</programlisting>
<simpara>You can disable the Health Indicator by setting <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.health.enabled=false</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_security">
<title>Security</title>
<simpara>You can secure your Config Server in any way that makes sense to you (from physical network security to OAuth2 bearer tokens), because Spring Security and Spring Boot offer support for many security arrangements.</simpara>
<simpara>To use the default Spring Boot-configured HTTP Basic security, include Spring Security on the classpath (for example, through <literal>spring-boot-starter-security</literal>).
The default is a username of <literal>user</literal> and a randomly generated password. A random password is not useful in practice, so we recommend you configure the password (by setting <literal>spring.security.user.password</literal>) and encrypt it (see below for instructions on how to do that).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_encryption_and_decryption_2">
<title>Encryption and Decryption</title>
<important>
<simpara>To use the encryption and decryption features you need the full-strength JCE installed in your JVM (it is not included by default).
You can download the <quote>Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files</quote> from Oracle and follow the installation instructions (essentially, you need to replace the two policy files in the JRE lib/security directory with the ones that you downloaded).</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>If the remote property sources contain encrypted content (values starting with <literal>{cipher}</literal>), they are decrypted before sending to clients over HTTP.
The main advantage of this setup is that the property values need not be in plain text when they are <quote>at rest</quote> (for example, in a git repository).
If a value cannot be decrypted, it is removed from the property source and an additional property is added with the same key but prefixed with <literal>invalid</literal> and a value that means <quote>not applicable</quote> (usually <literal>&lt;n/a&gt;</literal>).
This is largely to prevent cipher text being used as a password and accidentally leaking.</simpara>
<simpara>If you set up a remote config repository for config client applications, it might contain an <literal>application.yml</literal> similar to the following:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  datasource:
    username: dbuser
    password: '{cipher}FKSAJDFGYOS8F7GLHAKERGFHLSAJ'</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Encrypted values in a .properties file must not be wrapped in quotes. Otherwise, the value is not decrypted. The following example shows values that would work:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.properties</title>
<para>
<screen>spring.datasource.username: dbuser
spring.datasource.password: {cipher}FKSAJDFGYOS8F7GLHAKERGFHLSAJ</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>You can safely push this plain text to a shared git repository, and the secret password remains protected.</simpara>
<simpara>The server also exposes <literal>/encrypt</literal> and <literal>/decrypt</literal> endpoints (on the assumption that these are secured and only accessed by authorized agents).
If you edit a remote config file, you can use the Config Server to encrypt values by POSTing to the <literal>/encrypt</literal> endpoint, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>$ curl localhost:8888/encrypt -d mysecret
682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda</screen>
<note>
<simpara>If the value you encrypt has characters in it that need to be URL encoded, you should use the <literal>--data-urlencode</literal> option to <literal>curl</literal> to make sure they are encoded properly.</simpara>
</note>
<tip>
<simpara>Be sure not to include any of the curl command statistics in the encrypted value.
Outputting the value to a file can help avoid this problem.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>The inverse operation is also available through <literal>/decrypt</literal> (provided the server is
configured with a symmetric key or a full key pair), as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>$ curl localhost:8888/decrypt -d 682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda
mysecret</screen>
<tip>
<simpara>If you testing with curl, then use <literal>--data-urlencode</literal> (instead of <literal>-d</literal>) or set an explicit <literal>Content-Type: text/plain</literal> to make sure curl encodes the data correctly when there are special characters ('+' is particularly tricky).</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>Take the encrypted value and add the <literal>{cipher}</literal> prefix before you put it in the YAML or properties file and before you commit and push it to a remote (potentially insecure) store.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>/encrypt</literal> and <literal>/decrypt</literal> endpoints also both accept paths in the form of <literal>/*/{application}/{profiles}</literal>, which can be used to control cryptography on a per-application (name) and per-profile basis when clients call into the main environment resource.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>To control the cryptography in this granular way, you must also provide a <literal>@Bean</literal> of type <literal>TextEncryptorLocator</literal> that creates a different encryptor per name and profiles.
The one that is provided by default does not do so (all encryptions use the same key).</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>The <literal>spring</literal> command line client (with Spring Cloud CLI extensions
installed) can also be used to encrypt and decrypt, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>$ spring encrypt mysecret --key foo
682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda
$ spring decrypt --key foo 682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda
mysecret</screen>
<simpara>To use a key in a file (such as an RSA public key for encryption), prepend
the key value with "@" and provide the file path, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>$ spring encrypt mysecret --key @${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
AQAjPgt3eFZQXwt8tsHAVv/QHiY5sI2dRcR+...</screen>
<note>
<simpara>The <literal>--key</literal> argument is mandatory (despite having a <literal>--</literal> prefix).</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_key_management">
<title>Key Management</title>
<simpara>The Config Server can use a symmetric (shared) key or an asymmetric one (RSA key pair).
The asymmetric choice is superior in terms of security, but it is often more convenient to use a symmetric key since it is a single property value to configure in the <literal>bootstrap.properties</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To configure a symmetric key, you need to set <literal>encrypt.key</literal> to a secret String (or use the <literal>ENCRYPT_KEY</literal> environment variable to keep it out of plain-text configuration files).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>You cannot configure an asymmetric key using <literal>encrypt.key</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>To configure an asymmetric key use a keystore (e.g. as
created by the <literal>keytool</literal> utility that comes with the JDK). The
keystore properties are <literal>encrypt.keyStore.*</literal> with <literal>*</literal> equal to</simpara>

<simpara>The encryption is done with the public key, and a private key is
needed for decryption.
Thus, in principle, you can configure only the public key in the server if you want to only encrypt (and are prepared to decrypt the values yourself locally with the private key).
In practice, you might not want to do decrypt locally, because it spreads the key management process around all the clients, instead of
concentrating it in the server.
On the other hand, it can be a useful option if your config server is relatively insecure and only a handful of clients need the encrypted properties.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_creating_a_key_store_for_testing">
<title>Creating a Key Store for Testing</title>
<simpara>To create a keystore for testing, you can use a command resembling the following:</simpara>
<screen>$ keytool -genkeypair -alias mytestkey -keyalg RSA \
  -dname "CN=Web Server,OU=Unit,O=Organization,L=City,S=State,C=US" \
  -keypass changeme -keystore server.jks -storepass letmein</screen>
<note>
<simpara>When using JDK 11 or above you may get the following warning when using the command above.  In this case

</note>
<screen>Warning:  Different store and key passwords not supported for PKCS12 KeyStores. Ignoring user-specified -keypass value.</screen>
<simpara>Put the <literal>server.jks</literal> file in the classpath (for instance) and then, in

<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">encrypt:
  keyStore:
    location: classpath:/server.jks
    password: letmein
    alias: mytestkey
    secret: changeme</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_using_multiple_keys_and_key_rotation">
<title>Using Multiple Keys and Key Rotation</title>
<simpara>In addition to the <literal>{cipher}</literal> prefix in encrypted property values, the Config Server looks for zero or more <literal>{name:value}</literal> prefixes before the start of the (Base64 encoded) cipher text.
The keys are passed to a <literal>TextEncryptorLocator</literal>, which can do whatever logic it needs to locate a <literal>TextEncryptor</literal> for the cipher.
If you have configured a keystore (<literal>encrypt.keystore.location</literal>), the default locator looks for keys with aliases supplied by the <literal>key</literal> prefix, with a cipher text like resembling the following:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">foo:
  bar: `{cipher}{key:testkey}...`</programlisting>
<simpara>The locator looks for a key named "testkey".
A secret can also be supplied by using a <literal>{secret:&#8230;&#8203;}</literal> value in the prefix.
However, if it is not supplied, the default is to use the keystore password (which is what you get when you build a keystore and do not specify a secret).
If you do supply a secret, you should also encrypt the secret using a custom <literal>SecretLocator</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>When the keys are being used only to encrypt a few bytes of configuration data (that is, they are not being used elsewhere), key rotation is hardly ever necessary on cryptographic grounds.
However, you might occasionally  need to change the keys (for example, in the event of a security breach).
In that case, all the clients would need to change their source config files (for example, in git) and use a new <literal>{key:&#8230;&#8203;}</literal> prefix in all the ciphers.
Note that the clients need to first check that the key alias is available in the Config Server keystore.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>If you want to let the Config Server handle all encryption as well as decryption, the <literal>{name:value}</literal> prefixes can also be added as plain text posted to the <literal>/encrypt</literal> endpoint, .</simpara>
</tip>

<section xml:id="_serving_encrypted_properties">
<title>Serving Encrypted Properties</title>
<simpara>Sometimes you want the clients to decrypt the configuration locally, instead of doing it in the server.
In that case, if you provide the <literal>encrypt.*</literal> configuration to locate a key, you can still have <literal>/encrypt</literal> and <literal>/decrypt</literal> endpoints, but you need to explicitly switch off the decryption of outgoing properties by placing <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.encrypt.enabled=false</literal> in <literal>bootstrap.[yml|properties]</literal>.
If you do not care about the endpoints, it should work if you do not configure either the key or the enabled flag.</simpara>

</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_serving_alternative_formats">
<title>Serving Alternative Formats</title>
<simpara>The default JSON format from the environment endpoints is perfect for consumption by Spring applications, because it maps directly onto the <literal>Environment</literal> abstraction.
If you prefer, you can consume the same data as YAML or Java properties by adding a suffix (".yml", ".yaml" or ".properties") to the resource path.
This can be useful for consumption by applications that do not care about the structure of the JSON endpoints or the extra metadata they provide (for example, an application that is not using Spring might benefit from the simplicity of this approach).</simpara>
<simpara>The YAML and properties representations have an additional flag (provided as a boolean query parameter called <literal>resolvePlaceholders</literal>) to signal that placeholders in the source documents (in the standard Spring <literal>${&#8230;&#8203;}</literal> form) should be resolved in the output before rendering, where possible.
This is a useful feature for consumers that do not know about the Spring placeholder conventions.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>There are limitations in using the YAML or properties formats, mainly in relation to the loss of metadata.
For example, the JSON is structured as an ordered list of property sources, with names that correlate with the source.
The YAML and properties forms are coalesced into a single map, even if the origin of the values has multiple sources, and the names of the original source files are lost.
Also, the YAML representation is not necessarily a faithful representation of the YAML source in a backing repository either. It is constructed from a list of flat property sources, and assumptions have to be made about the form of the keys.</simpara>
</note>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_serving_plain_text">
<title>Serving Plain Text</title>
<simpara>Instead of using the <literal>Environment</literal> abstraction (or one of the alternative representations of it in YAML or properties format), your applications might need generic plain-text configuration files that are tailored to their environment.
The Config Server provides these through an additional endpoint at <literal>/{application}/{profile}/{label}/{path}</literal>, where <literal>application</literal>, <literal>profile</literal>, and <literal>label</literal> have the same meaning as the regular environment endpoint, but <literal>path</literal> is a path to a file name (such as <literal>log.xml</literal>).
The source files for this endpoint are located in the same way as for the environment endpoints.
The same search path is used for properties and YAML files.
However, instead of aggregating all matching resources, only the first one to match is returned.</simpara>
<simpara>After a resource is located, placeholders in the normal format (<literal>${&#8230;&#8203;}</literal>) are resolved by using the effective <literal>Environment</literal> for the supplied application name, profile, and label.
In this way, the resource endpoint is tightly integrated with the environment endpoints.
Consider the following example for a GIT or SVN repository:</simpara>
<screen>application.yml
nginx.conf</screen>
<simpara>where <literal>nginx.conf</literal> looks like this:</simpara>
<screen>server {
    listen              80;
    server_name         ${nginx.server.name};
}</screen>

<note>
<simpara>As with the source files for environment configuration, the <literal>profile</literal> is used to resolve the file name.

<simpara>If you do not want to supply the <literal>label</literal> and let the server use the default label, you can supply a <literal>useDefaultLabel</literal> request parameter.
So, the preceding example for the <literal>default</literal> profile could be <literal>/foo/default/nginx.conf?useDefaultLabel</literal>.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_embedding_the_config_server">
<title>Embedding the Config Server</title>
<simpara>The Config Server runs best as a standalone application.
However, if need be, you can embed it in another application.
To do so, use the <literal>@EnableConfigServer</literal> annotation.
An optional property named <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.bootstrap</literal> can be useful in this case.
It is a flag to indicate whether the server should configure itself from its own remote repository.
By default, the flag is off, because it can delay startup.
However, when embedded in another application, it makes sense to initialize the same way as any other application.
When setting <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.bootstrap</literal> to <literal>true</literal> you must also use a <link linkend="composite-environment-repositories">composite environment repository configuration</link>.
For example</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  application:
    name: configserver
  profiles:
    active: composite
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        composite:
          - type: native
            search-locations: ${HOME}/Desktop/config
        bootstrap: true</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>If you use the bootstrap flag, the config server needs to have its name and repository URI configured in <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>To change the location of the server endpoints, you can (optionally) set <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.prefix</literal> (for example, <literal>/config</literal>), to serve the resources under a prefix.
The prefix should start but not end with a <literal>/</literal>.
It is applied to the <literal>@RequestMappings</literal> in the Config Server (that is, underneath the Spring Boot <literal>server.servletPath</literal> and <literal>server.contextPath</literal> prefixes).</simpara>
<simpara>If you want to read the configuration for an application directly from the backend repository (instead of from the config server), you
basically want an embedded config server with no endpoints.
You can switch off the endpoints entirely by not using the <literal>@EnableConfigServer</literal> annotation (set <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.bootstrap=true</literal>).</simpara>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_push_notifications_and_spring_cloud_bus">
<title>Push Notifications and Spring Cloud Bus</title>
<simpara>Many source code repository providers (such as Github, Gitlab, Gitea, Gitee, Gogs, or Bitbucket) notify you of changes in a repository through a webhook.
You can configure the webhook through the provider&#8217;s user interface as a URL and a set of events in which you are interested.
For instance, <link xl:href="https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pushevent">Github</link> uses a POST to the webhook with a JSON body containing a list of commits and a header (<literal>X-Github-Event</literal>) set to <literal>push</literal>.
If you add a dependency on the <literal>spring-cloud-config-monitor</literal> library and activate the Spring Cloud Bus in your Config Server, then a <literal>/monitor</literal> endpoint is enabled.</simpara>
<simpara>When the webhook is activated, the Config Server sends a <literal>RefreshRemoteApplicationEvent</literal> targeted at the applications it thinks might have changed.
The change detection can be strategized.
However, by default, it looks for changes in files that match the application name (for example, <literal>foo.properties</literal> is targeted at the <literal>foo</literal> application, while <literal>application.properties</literal> is targeted at all applications).
The strategy to use when you want to override the behavior is <literal>PropertyPathNotificationExtractor</literal>, which accepts the request headers and body as parameters and returns a list of file paths that changed.</simpara>
<simpara>The default configuration works out of the box with Github, Gitlab, Gitea, Gitee, Gogs or Bitbucket.
In addition to the JSON notifications from Github, Gitlab, Gitee, or Bitbucket, you can trigger a change notification by POSTing to <literal>/monitor</literal> with form-encoded body parameters in the pattern of <literal>path={application}</literal>.
Doing so broadcasts to applications matching the <literal>{application}</literal> pattern (which can contain wildcards).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The <literal>RefreshRemoteApplicationEvent</literal> is transmitted only if the <literal>spring-cloud-bus</literal> is activated in both the Config Server and in the client application.</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>The default configuration also detects filesystem changes in local git repositories. In that case, the webhook is not used. However, as soon as you edit a config file, a refresh is broadcast.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_spring_cloud_config_client">
<title>Spring Cloud Config Client</title>
<simpara>A Spring Boot application can take immediate advantage of the Spring Config Server (or other external property sources provided by the application developer).
It also picks up some additional useful features related to <literal>Environment</literal> change events.</simpara>
<section xml:id="config-first-bootstrap">
<title>Config First Bootstrap</title>
<simpara>The default behavior for any application that has the Spring Cloud Config Client on the classpath is as follows:
When a config client starts, it binds to the Config Server (through the <literal>spring.cloud.config.uri</literal> bootstrap configuration property) and initializes Spring <literal>Environment</literal> with remote property sources.</simpara>
<simpara>The net result of this behavior is that all client applications that want to consume the Config Server need a <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal> (or an environment variable) with the server address set in <literal>spring.cloud.config.uri</literal> (it defaults to "http://localhost:8888").</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="discovery-first-bootstrap">
<title>Discovery First Bootstrap</title>
<simpara>If you use a <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> implementation, such as Spring Cloud Netflix and Eureka Service Discovery or Spring Cloud Consul, you can have the Config Server register with the Discovery Service.
However, in the default <quote>Config First</quote> mode, clients cannot take advantage of the registration.</simpara>
<simpara>If you prefer to use <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> to locate the Config Server, you can do so by setting <literal>spring.cloud.config.discovery.enabled=true</literal> (the default is <literal>false</literal>).
The net result of doing so is that client applications all need a <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal> (or an environment variable) with the appropriate discovery configuration.
For example, with Spring Cloud Netflix, you need to define the Eureka server address (for example, in <literal>eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone</literal>).
The price for using this option is an extra network round trip on startup, to locate the service registration.
The benefit is that, as long as the Discovery Service is a fixed point, the Config Server can change its coordinates.
The default service ID is <literal>configserver</literal>, but you can change that on the client by setting <literal>spring.cloud.config.discovery.serviceId</literal> (and on the server, in the usual way for a service, such as by setting <literal>spring.application.name</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>The discovery client implementations all support some kind of metadata map (for example, we have <literal>eureka.instance.metadataMap</literal> for Eureka).
Some additional properties of the Config Server may need to be configured in its service registration metadata so that clients can connect correctly.
If the Config Server is secured with HTTP Basic, you can configure the credentials as <literal>user</literal> and <literal>password</literal>.
Also, if the Config Server has a context path, you can set <literal>configPath</literal>.
For example, the following YAML file is for a Config Server that is a Eureka client:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>bootstrap.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">eureka:
  instance:

<section xml:id="config-client-fail-fast">
<title>Config Client Fail Fast</title>
<simpara>In some cases, you may want to fail startup of a service if it cannot connect to the Config Server.
If this is the desired behavior, set the bootstrap configuration property <literal>spring.cloud.config.fail-fast=true</literal> to make the client halt with an Exception.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="config-client-retry">
<title>Config Client Retry</title>
<simpara>If you expect that the config server may occasionally be unavailable when your application starts, you can make it keep trying after a failure.
First, you need to set <literal>spring.cloud.config.fail-fast=true</literal>.
Then you need to add <literal>spring-retry</literal> and <literal>spring-boot-starter-aop</literal> to your classpath.
The default behavior is to retry six times with an initial backoff interval of 1000ms and an exponential multiplier of 1.1 for subsequent backoffs.
You can configure these properties (and others) by setting the <literal>spring.cloud.config.retry.*</literal> configuration properties.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>To take full control of the retry behavior, add a <literal>@Bean</literal> of type <literal>RetryOperationsInterceptor</literal> with an ID of <literal>configServerRetryInterceptor</literal>.
Spring Retry has a <literal>RetryInterceptorBuilder</literal> that supports creating one.</simpara>

</itemizedlist>
<note>
<simpara>When setting the property <literal>${spring.application.name}</literal> do not prefix your app name with the reserved word <literal>application-</literal> to prevent issues resolving the correct property source.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>You can override all of them by setting <literal>spring.cloud.config.*</literal> (where <literal>*</literal> is <literal>name</literal>, <literal>profile</literal> or <literal>label</literal>).
The <literal>label</literal> is useful for rolling back to previous versions of configuration.
With the default Config Server implementation, it can be a git label, branch name, or commit ID.
Label can also be provided as a comma-separated list.
In that case, the items in the list are tried one by one until one succeeds.
This behavior can be useful when working on a feature branch.
For instance, you might want to align the config label with your branch but make it optional (in that case, use <literal>spring.cloud.config.label=myfeature,develop</literal>).</simpara>

<section xml:id="_specifying_multiple_urls_for_the_config_server">
<title>Specifying Multiple Urls for the Config Server</title>
<simpara>To ensure high availability when you have multiple instances of Config Server deployed and expect one or more instances to be unavailable from time to time, you can either specify multiple URLs (as a comma-separated list under the <literal>spring.cloud.config.uri</literal> property) or have all your instances register in a Service Registry like Eureka ( if using Discovery-First Bootstrap mode ). Note that doing so ensures high availability only when the Config Server is not running (that is, when the application has exited) or when a connection timeout has occurred. For example, if the Config Server returns a 500 (Internal Server Error) response or the Config Client receives a 401 from the Config Server (due to bad credentials or other causes), the Config Client does not try to fetch properties from other URLs. An error of that kind indicates a user issue rather than an availability problem.</simpara>
<simpara>If you use HTTP basic security on your Config Server, it is currently possible to support per-Config Server auth credentials only if you embed the credentials in each URL you specify under the <literal>spring.cloud.config.uri</literal> property. If you use any other kind of security mechanism, you cannot (currently) support per-Config Server authentication and authorization.</simpara>

<simpara>When a client registers with Eureka, it provides meta-data about itself&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;such as host, port, health indicator URL, home page, and other details.
Eureka receives heartbeat messages from each instance belonging to a service.
If the heartbeat fails over a configurable timetable, the instance is normally removed from the registry.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows a minimal Eureka client application:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@RestController

    }

}</programlisting>
<simpara>Note that the preceding example shows a normal <link xl:href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</link> application.
By having <literal>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</literal> on the classpath, your application automatically registers with the Eureka Server.  Configuration is required to locate the Eureka server, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>

  client:
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/</screen>

</formalpara>
<simpara>In the preceding example, "defaultZone" is a magic string fallback value that provides the service URL for any client that does not express a preference (in other words, it is a useful default).</simpara>
<simpara>The default application name (that is, the service ID), virtual host, and non-secure port (taken from the <literal>Environment</literal>) are <literal>${spring.application.name}</literal>, <literal>${spring.application.name}</literal> and <literal>${server.port}</literal>, respectively.</simpara>
<simpara>Having <literal>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</literal> on the classpath makes the app into both a Eureka <quote>instance</quote> (that is, it registers itself) and a <quote>client</quote> (it can query the registry to locate other services).
The instance behaviour is driven by <literal>eureka.instance.*</literal> configuration keys, but the defaults are fine if you ensure that your application has a value for <literal>spring.application.name</literal> (this is the default for the Eureka service ID or VIP).</simpara>
<simpara>See <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/tree/master/spring-cloud-netflix-eureka-client/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/netflix/eureka/EurekaInstanceConfigBean.java">EurekaInstanceConfigBean</link> and <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/tree/master/spring-cloud-netflix-eureka-client/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/netflix/eureka/EurekaClientConfigBean.java">EurekaClientConfigBean</link> for more details on the configurable options.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_status_page_and_health_indicator">
<title>Status Page and Health Indicator</title>
<simpara>The status page and health indicators for a Eureka instance default to <literal>/info</literal> and <literal>/health</literal> respectively, which are the default locations of useful endpoints in a Spring Boot Actuator application.
You need to change these, even for an Actuator application if you use a non-default context path or servlet path (such as <literal>server.servletPath=/custom</literal>). The following example shows the default values for the two settings:</simpara>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>eureka.instance.[securePortEnabled]=[true]</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Doing so makes Eureka publish instance information that shows an explicit preference for secure communication.
The Spring Cloud <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> always returns a URI starting with <literal>https</literal> for a service configured this way.
Similarly, when a service is configured this way, the Eureka (native) instance information has a secure health check URL.</simpara>
<simpara>Because of the way Eureka works internally, it still publishes a non-secure URL for the status and home pages unless you also override those explicitly.
You can use placeholders to configure the eureka instance URLs, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>eureka:
  instance:
    statusPageUrl: https://${eureka.hostname}/info
    healthCheckUrl: https://${eureka.hostname}/health
    homePageUrl: https://${eureka.hostname}/</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>(Note that <literal>${eureka.hostname}</literal> is a native placeholder only available
in later versions of Eureka. You could achieve the same thing with
Spring placeholders as well&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for example, by using <literal>${eureka.instance.hostName}</literal>.)</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>If your application runs behind a proxy, and the SSL termination is in the proxy (for example, if you run in Cloud Foundry or other platforms as a service), then you need to ensure that the proxy <quote>forwarded</quote> headers are intercepted and handled by the application.
If the Tomcat container embedded in a Spring Boot application has explicit configuration for the 'X-Forwarded-\*` headers, this happens automatically.
The links rendered by your app to itself being wrong (the wrong host, port, or protocol) is a sign that you got this configuration wrong.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_eurekas_health_checks">
<title>Eureka&#8217;s Health Checks</title>
<simpara>By default, Eureka uses the client heartbeat to determine if a client is up.
Unless specified otherwise, the Discovery Client does not propagate the current health check status of the application, per the Spring Boot Actuator.
Consequently, after successful registration, Eureka always announces that the application is in 'UP' state. This behavior can be altered by enabling Eureka health checks, which results in propagating application status to Eureka.
As a consequence, every other application does not send traffic to applications in states other then 'UP'.
The following example shows how to enable health checks for the client:</simpara>

<section xml:id="_eureka_metadata_for_instances_and_clients">
<title>Eureka Metadata for Instances and Clients</title>
<simpara>It is worth spending a bit of time understanding how the Eureka metadata works, so you can use it in a way that makes sense in your platform.
There is standard metadata for information such as hostname, IP address, port numbers, the status page, and health check.
These are published in the service registry and used by clients to contact the services in a straightforward way.
Additional metadata can be added to the instance registration in the <literal>eureka.instance.metadataMap</literal>, and this metadata is accessible in the remote clients.
In general, additional metadata does not change the behavior of the client, unless the client is made aware of the meaning of the metadata.
There are a couple of special cases, described later in this document, where Spring Cloud already assigns meaning to the metadata map.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_using_eureka_on_cloud_foundry">
<title>Using Eureka on Cloud Foundry</title>
<simpara>Cloud Foundry has a global router so that all instances of the same app have the same hostname (other PaaS solutions with a similar architecture have the same arrangement).
This is not necessarily a barrier to using Eureka.
However, if you use the router (recommended or even mandatory, depending on the way your platform was set up), you need to explicitly set the hostname and port numbers (secure or non-secure) so that they use the router.
You might also want to use instance metadata so that you can distinguish between the instances on the client (for example, in a custom load balancer).
By default, the <literal>eureka.instance.instanceId</literal> is <literal>vcap.application.instance_id</literal>, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>eureka:
  instance:
    hostname: ${vcap.application.uris[0]}
    nonSecurePort: 80</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Depending on the way the security rules are set up in your Cloud Foundry instance, you might be able to register and use the IP address of the host VM for direct service-to-service calls.
This feature is not yet available on Pivotal Web Services (<link xl:href="https://run.pivotal.io">PWS</link>).</simpara>

<section xml:id="_using_eureka_on_aws">
<title>Using Eureka on AWS</title>
<simpara>If the application is planned to be deployed to an AWS cloud, the Eureka instance must be configured to be AWS-aware. You can do so by customizing the <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/tree/master/spring-cloud-netflix-eureka-client/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/netflix/eureka/EurekaInstanceConfigBean.java">EurekaInstanceConfigBean</link> as follows:</simpara>

<section xml:id="_changing_the_eureka_instance_id">
<title>Changing the Eureka Instance ID</title>
<simpara>A vanilla Netflix Eureka instance is registered with an ID that is equal to its host name (that is, there is only one service per host).
Spring Cloud Eureka provides a sensible default, which is defined as follows:</simpara>
<simpara><literal>${spring.cloud.client.hostname}:${spring.application.name}:${spring.application.instance_id:${server.port}}}</literal></simpara>
<simpara>An example is <literal>myhost:myappname:8080</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>By using Spring Cloud, you can override this value by providing a unique identifier in <literal>eureka.instance.instanceId</literal>, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>eureka:
  instance:
    instanceId: ${spring.application.name}:${vcap.application.instance_id:${spring.application.instance_id:${random.value}}}</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>With the metadata shown in the preceding example and multiple service instances deployed on localhost, the random value is inserted there to make the instance unique.
In Cloud Foundry, the <literal>vcap.application.instance_id</literal> is populated automatically in a Spring Boot application, so the random value is not needed.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_using_the_eurekaclient">
<title>Using the EurekaClient</title>
<simpara>Once you have an application that is a discovery client, you can use it to discover service instances from the <link linkend="spring-cloud-eureka-server">Eureka Server</link>.
One way to do so is to use the native <literal>com.netflix.discovery.EurekaClient</literal> (as opposed to the Spring Cloud <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal>), as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>@Autowired
private EurekaClient discoveryClient;

public String serviceUrl() {
    InstanceInfo instance = discoveryClient.getNextServerFromEureka("STORES", false);
    return instance.getHomePageUrl();

<simpara>Do not use the <literal>EurekaClient</literal> in a <literal>@PostConstruct</literal> method or in a <literal>@Scheduled</literal> method (or anywhere where the <literal>ApplicationContext</literal> might not be started yet).
It is initialized in a <literal>SmartLifecycle</literal> (with <literal>phase=0</literal>), so the earliest you can rely on it being available is in another <literal>SmartLifecycle</literal> with a higher phase.</simpara>
</tip>
<section xml:id="_eurekaclient_without_jersey">
<title>EurekaClient without Jersey</title>
<simpara>By default, EurekaClient uses Jersey for HTTP communication.
If you wish to avoid dependencies from Jersey, you can exclude it from your dependencies.
Spring Cloud auto-configures a transport client based on Spring <literal>RestTemplate</literal>.
The following example shows Jersey being excluded:</simpara>
<screen>&lt;dependency&gt;

<section xml:id="_alternatives_to_the_native_netflix_eurekaclient">
<title>Alternatives to the Native Netflix EurekaClient</title>
<simpara>You need not use the raw Netflix <literal>EurekaClient</literal>.
Also, it is usually more convenient to use it behind a wrapper of some sort.
Spring Cloud has support for <link linkend="spring-cloud-feign">Feign</link> (a REST client builder) and <link linkend="spring-cloud-ribbon">Spring <literal>RestTemplate</literal></link> through the logical Eureka service identifiers (VIPs) instead of physical URLs.
To configure Ribbon with a fixed list of physical servers, you can set <literal>&lt;client&gt;.ribbon.listOfServers</literal> to a comma-separated list of physical addresses (or hostnames), where <literal>&lt;client&gt;</literal> is the ID of the client.</simpara>
<simpara>You can also use the <literal>org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.DiscoveryClient</literal>, which provides a simple API (not specific to Netflix) for discovery clients, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>@Autowired
private DiscoveryClient discoveryClient;

public String serviceUrl() {
    List&lt;ServiceInstance&gt; list = discoveryClient.getInstances("STORES");
    if (list != null &amp;&amp; list.size() &gt; 0 ) {

}</screen>
</section>
<section xml:id="_why_is_it_so_slow_to_register_a_service">
<title>Why Is It so Slow to Register a Service?</title>
<simpara>Being an instance also involves a periodic heartbeat to the registry
(through the client&#8217;s <literal>serviceUrl</literal>) with a default duration of 30 seconds.
A service is not available for discovery by clients until the instance, the server, and the client all have the same metadata in their local
cache (so it could take 3 heartbeats).
You can change the period by setting <literal>eureka.instance.leaseRenewalIntervalInSeconds</literal>.
Setting it to a value of less than 30 speeds up the process of getting clients connected to other services.
In production, it is probably better to stick with the default, because of internal computations in the server that make assumptions about the lease renewal period.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_zones">
<title>Zones</title>
<simpara>If you have deployed Eureka clients to multiple zones, you may prefer that those clients use services within the same zone before trying services in another zone.
To set that up, you need to configure your Eureka clients correctly.</simpara>
<simpara>First, you need to make sure you have Eureka servers deployed to each zone and that
they are peers of each other.
See the section on <link linkend="spring-cloud-eureka-server-zones-and-regions">zones and regions</link>
for more information.</simpara>
<simpara>Next, you need to tell Eureka which zone your service is in.
You can do so by using the <literal>metadataMap</literal> property.
For example, if <literal>service 1</literal> is deployed to both <literal>zone 1</literal> and <literal>zone 2</literal>, you need to set the following Eureka properties in <literal>service 1</literal>:</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Service 1 in Zone 1</emphasis></simpara>
<screen>eureka.instance.metadataMap.zone = zone1
eureka.client.preferSameZoneEureka = true</screen>

<section xml:id="_refreshing_eureka_clients">
<title>Refreshing Eureka Clients</title>
<simpara>By default, the <literal>EurekaClient</literal> bean is refreshable, meaning the Eureka client properties can be changed and refreshed.
When a refresh occurs clients will be unregistered from the Eureka server and there might be a brief moment of time
where all instance of a given service are not available. One way to eliminate this from happening is to disable
the ability to refresh Eureka clients.  To do this set <literal>eureka.client.refresh.enable=false</literal>.</simpara>

<simpara>By default, every Eureka server is also a Eureka client and requires (at least one) service URL to locate a peer.

<title>Standalone Mode</title>
<simpara>The combination of the two caches (client and server) and the heartbeats make a standalone Eureka server fairly resilient to failure, as long as there is some sort of monitor or elastic runtime (such as Cloud Foundry) keeping it alive.
In standalone mode, you might prefer to switch off the client side behavior so that it does not keep trying and failing to reach its peers.
The following example shows how to switch off the client-side behavior:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml (Standalone Eureka Server)</title>
<para>
<screen>server:
  port: 8761

eureka:
  instance:

</section>
<section xml:id="spring-cloud-eureka-server-peer-awareness">
<title>Peer Awareness</title>
<simpara>Eureka can be made even more resilient and available by running multiple instances and asking them to register with each other.
In fact, this is the default behavior, so all you need to do to make it work is add a valid <literal>serviceUrl</literal> to a peer, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml (Two Peer Aware Eureka Servers)</title>
<para>

spring:

eureka:
  instance:
    hostname: peer2
  client:
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://peer1/eureka/</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>In the preceding example, we have a YAML file that can be used to run the same server on two hosts (<literal>peer1</literal> and <literal>peer2</literal>) by running it in different Spring profiles.
You could use this configuration to test the peer awareness on a single host (there is not much value in doing that in production) by manipulating <literal>/etc/hosts</literal> to resolve the host names.
In fact, the <literal>eureka.instance.hostname</literal> is not needed if you are running on a machine that knows its own hostname (by default, it is looked up by using <literal>java.net.InetAddress</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>You can add multiple peers to a system, and, as long as they are all connected to each other by at least one edge, they synchronize
the registrations amongst themselves.
If the peers are physically separated (inside a data center or between multiple data centers), then the system can, in principle, survive <quote>split-brain</quote> type failures.

<simpara>If the hostname cannot be determined by Java, then the IP address is sent to Eureka.
Only explict way of setting the hostname is by setting <literal>eureka.instance.hostname</literal> property.

<title>Securing The Eureka Server</title>
<simpara>You can secure your Eureka server simply by adding Spring Security to your

a valid CSRF token be sent with every request to the app.  Eureka clients will not generally possess a valid

For example:</simpara>

<title>Circuit Breaker: Hystrix Clients</title>
<simpara>Netflix has created a library called <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix">Hystrix</link> that implements the <link xl:href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html">circuit breaker pattern</link>.
In a microservice architecture, it is common to have multiple layers of service calls, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<figure>
<title>Microservice Graph</title>

</imageobject>
<textobject><phrase>Hystrix</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>A service failure in the lower level of services can cause cascading failure all the way up to the user.
When calls to a particular service exceed <literal>circuitBreaker.requestVolumeThreshold</literal> (default: 20 requests) and the failure percentage is greater than <literal>circuitBreaker.errorThresholdPercentage</literal> (default: &gt;50%) in a rolling window defined by <literal>metrics.rollingStats.timeInMilliseconds</literal> (default: 10 seconds), the circuit opens and the call is not made.
In cases of error and an open circuit, a fallback can be provided by the developer.</simpara>
<figure>
<title>Hystrix fallback prevents cascading failures</title>

</imageobject>
<textobject><phrase>HystrixFallback</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>Having an open circuit stops cascading failures and allows overwhelmed or failing services time to recover.
The fallback can be another Hystrix protected call, static data, or a sensible empty value.
Fallbacks may be chained so that the first fallback makes some other business call, which in turn falls back to static data.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_how_to_include_hystrix">
<title>How to Include Hystrix</title>
<simpara>To include Hystrix in your project, use the starter with a group ID of <literal>org.springframework.cloud</literal>
and a artifact ID of <literal>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-hystrix</literal>.
See the <link xl:href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/">Spring Cloud Project page</link> for details on setting up your build system with the current Spring Cloud Release Train.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows a minimal Eureka server with a Hystrix circuit breaker:</simpara>
<screen>@SpringBootApplication
@EnableCircuitBreaker
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new SpringApplicationBuilder(Application.class).web(true).run(args);
    }

}

@Component
public class StoreIntegration {

    @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "defaultStores")
    public Object getStores(Map&lt;String, Object&gt; parameters) {
        //do stuff that might fail
    }

    public Object defaultStores(Map&lt;String, Object&gt; parameters) {
        return /* something useful */;
    }
}</screen>
<simpara>The <literal>@HystrixCommand</literal> is provided by a Netflix contrib library called <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/tree/master/hystrix-contrib/hystrix-javanica"><quote>javanica</quote></link>.
Spring Cloud automatically wraps Spring beans with that annotation in a proxy that is connected to the Hystrix circuit breaker.
The circuit breaker calculates when to open and close the circuit and what to do in case of a failure.</simpara>
<simpara>To configure the <literal>@HystrixCommand</literal> you can use the <literal>commandProperties</literal>
attribute with a list of <literal>@HystrixProperty</literal> annotations.  See
<link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/tree/master/hystrix-contrib/hystrix-javanica#configuration">here</link>
for more details.  See the <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/Configuration">Hystrix wiki</link>
for details on the properties available.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="netflix-hystrix-starter">
<title>Propagating the Security Context or Using Spring Scopes</title>
<simpara>If you want some thread local context to propagate into a <literal>@HystrixCommand</literal>, the default declaration does not work, because it executes the command in a thread pool (in case of timeouts).
You can switch Hystrix to use the same thread as the caller through configuration or directly in the annotation, by asking it to use a different <quote>Isolation Strategy</quote>.
The following example demonstrates setting the thread in the annotation:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "stubMyService",
    commandProperties = {
      @HystrixProperty(name="execution.isolation.strategy", value="SEMAPHORE")
    }
)
...</programlisting>
<simpara>The same thing applies if you are using <literal>@SessionScope</literal> or <literal>@RequestScope</literal>.
If you encounter a runtime exception that says it cannot find the scoped context, you need to use the same thread.</simpara>
<simpara>You also have the option to set the <literal>hystrix.shareSecurityContext</literal> property to <literal>true</literal>.
Doing so auto-configures a Hystrix concurrency strategy plugin hook to transfer the <literal>SecurityContext</literal> from your main thread to the one used by the Hystrix command.
Hystrix does not let multiple Hystrix concurrency strategy be registered so an extension mechanism is available by declaring your own <literal>HystrixConcurrencyStrategy</literal> as a Spring bean.
Spring Cloud looks for your implementation within the Spring context and wrap it inside its own plugin.</simpara>

<title>Hystrix Timeouts And Ribbon Clients</title>
<simpara>When using Hystrix commands that wrap Ribbon clients you want to make sure your Hystrix timeout
is configured to be longer than the configured Ribbon timeout, including any potential
retries that might be made.  For example, if your Ribbon connection timeout is one second and
the Ribbon client might retry the request three times, than your Hystrix timeout should
be slightly more than three seconds.</simpara>
<section xml:id="netflix-hystrix-dashboard-starter">
<title>How to Include the Hystrix Dashboard</title>
<simpara>To include the Hystrix Dashboard in your project, use the starter with a group ID of  <literal>org.springframework.cloud</literal> and an artifact ID of <literal>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-hystrix-dashboard</literal>.
See the <link xl:href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/">Spring Cloud Project page</link> for details on setting up your build system with the current Spring Cloud Release Train.</simpara>
<simpara>To run the Hystrix Dashboard, annotate your Spring Boot main class with <literal>@EnableHystrixDashboard</literal>.
Then visit <literal>/hystrix</literal> and point the dashboard to an individual instance&#8217;s <literal>/hystrix.stream</literal> endpoint in a Hystrix client application.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>When connecting to a <literal>/hystrix.stream</literal> endpoint that uses HTTPS, the certificate used by the server must be trusted by the JVM.
If the certificate is not trusted, you must import the certificate into the JVM in order for the Hystrix Dashboard to make a successful connection to the stream endpoint.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_turbine">
<title>Turbine</title>
<simpara>Looking at an individual instance&#8217;s Hystrix data is not very useful in terms of the overall health of the system.  <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/Turbine">Turbine</link> is an application that aggregates all of the relevant <literal>/hystrix.stream</literal> endpoints into a combined <literal>/turbine.stream</literal> for use in the Hystrix Dashboard.
Individual instances are located through Eureka.
Running Turbine requires annotating your main class with the <literal>@EnableTurbine</literal> annotation  (for example, by using spring-cloud-starter-netflix-turbine to set up the classpath).
All of the documented configuration properties from <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/Turbine/wiki/Configuration-(1.x)">the Turbine 1 wiki</link> apply.
The only difference is that the <literal>turbine.instanceUrlSuffix</literal> does not need the port prepended, as this is handled automatically unless <literal>turbine.instanceInsertPort=false</literal>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>By default, Turbine looks for the <literal>/hystrix.stream</literal> endpoint on a registered instance by looking up its <literal>hostName</literal> and <literal>port</literal> entries in Eureka and then appending <literal>/hystrix.stream</literal> to it.
If the instance&#8217;s metadata contains <literal>management.port</literal>, it is used instead of the <literal>port</literal> value for the <literal>/hystrix.stream</literal> endpoint.
By default, the metadata entry called <literal>management.port</literal> is equal to the <literal>management.port</literal> configuration property.
It can be overridden though with following configuration:</simpara>
</note>
<screen>eureka:
  instance:
    metadata-map:
      management.port: ${management.port:8081}</screen>
<simpara>The <literal>turbine.appConfig</literal> configuration key is a list of Eureka serviceIds that turbine uses to lookup instances.
The turbine stream is then used in the Hystrix dashboard with a URL similar to the following:</simpara>
<simpara><literal><link xl:href="https://my.turbine.server:8080/turbine.stream?cluster=CLUSTERNAME">https://my.turbine.server:8080/turbine.stream?cluster=CLUSTERNAME</link></literal></simpara>
<simpara>The cluster parameter can be omitted if the name is <literal>default</literal>.
The <literal>cluster</literal> parameter must match an entry in <literal>turbine.aggregator.clusterConfig</literal>.
Values returned from Eureka are upper-case. Consequently, the following example works if there is an application called <literal>customers</literal> registered with Eureka:</simpara>
<screen>turbine:
  aggregator:
    clusterConfig: CUSTOMERS
  appConfig: customers</screen>
<simpara>If you need to customize which cluster names should be used by Turbine (because you do not want to store cluster names in
<literal>turbine.aggregator.clusterConfig</literal> configuration), provide a bean of type <literal>TurbineClustersProvider</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>clusterName</literal> can be customized by a SPEL expression in <literal>turbine.clusterNameExpression</literal> with root as an instance of <literal>InstanceInfo</literal>.
The default value is <literal>appName</literal>, which means that the Eureka <literal>serviceId</literal> becomes the cluster key (that is, the <literal>InstanceInfo</literal> for customers has an <literal>appName</literal> of <literal>CUSTOMERS</literal>).
A different example is <literal>turbine.clusterNameExpression=aSGName</literal>, which gets the cluster name from the AWS ASG name.
The following listing shows another example:</simpara>
<screen>turbine:
  aggregator:
    clusterConfig: SYSTEM,USER
  appConfig: customers,stores,ui,admin
  clusterNameExpression: metadata['cluster']</screen>
<simpara>In the preceding example, the cluster name from four services is pulled from their metadata map and is expected to have values that include <literal>SYSTEM</literal> and <literal>USER</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To use the <quote>default</quote> cluster for all apps, you need a string literal expression (with single quotes and escaped with double quotes if it is in YAML as well):</simpara>
<screen>turbine:
  appConfig: customers,stores
  clusterNameExpression: "'default'"</screen>
<simpara>Spring Cloud provides a <literal>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-turbine</literal> that has all the dependencies you need to get a Turbine server running. To add Turbine, create a Spring Boot application and annotate it with <literal>@EnableTurbine</literal>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>By default, Spring Cloud lets Turbine use the host and port to allow multiple processes per host, per cluster.
If you want the native Netflix behavior built into Turbine to <emphasis>not</emphasis> allow multiple processes per host, per cluster (the key to the instance ID is the hostname), set <literal>turbine.combineHostPort=false</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
<section xml:id="_clusters_endpoint">

<section xml:id="_turbine_stream">
<title>Turbine Stream</title>
<simpara>In some environments (such as in a PaaS setting), the classic Turbine model of pulling metrics from all the distributed Hystrix commands does not work.
In that case, you might want to have your Hystrix commands push metrics to Turbine. Spring Cloud enables that with messaging.
To do so on the client, add a dependency to <literal>spring-cloud-netflix-hystrix-stream</literal> and the <literal>spring-cloud-starter-stream-*</literal> of your choice.
See the <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/">Spring Cloud Stream documentation</link> for details on the brokers and how to configure the client credentials. It should work out of the box for a local broker.</simpara>
<simpara>On the server side, create a Spring Boot application and annotate it with <literal>@EnableTurbineStream</literal>.
The Turbine Stream server requires the use of Spring Webflux, therefore <literal>spring-boot-starter-webflux</literal> needs to be included in your project.
By default <literal>spring-boot-starter-webflux</literal> is included when adding <literal>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-turbine-stream</literal> to your application.</simpara>
<simpara>You can then point the Hystrix Dashboard to the Turbine Stream Server instead of individual Hystrix streams.
If Turbine Stream is running on port 8989 on myhost, then put <literal><link xl:href="http://myhost:8989">http://myhost:8989</link></literal> in the stream input field in the Hystrix Dashboard.
Circuits are prefixed by their respective <literal>serviceId</literal>, followed by a dot (<literal>.</literal>), and then the circuit name.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud provides a <literal>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-turbine-stream</literal> that has all the dependencies you need to get a Turbine Stream server running.
You can then add the Stream binder of your choice&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;such as <literal>spring-cloud-starter-stream-rabbit</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Turbine Stream server also supports the <literal>cluster</literal> parameter.
Unlike Turbine server, Turbine Stream uses eureka serviceIds as cluster names and these are not configurable.</simpara>
<simpara>If Turbine Stream server is running on port 8989 on <literal>my.turbine.server</literal> and you have two eureka serviceIds <literal>customers</literal> and <literal>products</literal>  in your environment, the following URLs will be available on your Turbine Stream server. <literal>default</literal> and empty cluster name will provide all metrics that Turbine Stream server receives.</simpara>
<screen>https://my.turbine.sever:8989/turbine.stream?cluster=customers
https://my.turbine.sever:8989/turbine.stream?cluster=products
https://my.turbine.sever:8989/turbine.stream?cluster=default
https://my.turbine.sever:8989/turbine.stream</screen>
<simpara>So, you can use eureka serviceIds as cluster names for your Turbine dashboard (or any compatible dashboard).
You don’t need to configure any properties like <literal>turbine.appConfig</literal>, <literal>turbine.clusterNameExpression</literal> and <literal>turbine.aggregator.clusterConfig</literal> for your Turbine Stream server.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Turbine Stream server gathers all metrics from the configured input channel with Spring Cloud Stream. It means that it doesn’t gather Hystrix metrics actively from each instance. It just can provide metrics that were already gathered into the input channel by each instance.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="spring-cloud-ribbon">
<title>Client Side Load Balancer: Ribbon</title>
<simpara>Ribbon is a client-side load balancer that gives you a lot of control over the behavior of HTTP and TCP clients.
Feign already uses Ribbon, so, if you use <literal>@FeignClient</literal>, this section also applies.</simpara>
<simpara>A central concept in Ribbon is that of the named client.
Each load balancer is part of an ensemble of components that work together to contact a remote server on demand, and the ensemble has a name that you give it as an application developer (for example, by using the <literal>@FeignClient</literal> annotation).
On demand, Spring Cloud creates a new ensemble as an <literal>ApplicationContext</literal> for each named client by using
<literal>RibbonClientConfiguration</literal>.
This contains (amongst other things) an <literal>ILoadBalancer</literal>, a <literal>RestClient</literal>, and a <literal>ServerListFilter</literal>.</simpara>
<section xml:id="netflix-ribbon-starter">

</section>
<section xml:id="_customizing_the_ribbon_client">
<title>Customizing the Ribbon Client</title>
<simpara>You can configure some bits of a Ribbon client by using external properties in <literal>&lt;client&gt;.ribbon.*</literal>, which is similar to using the Netflix APIs natively, except that you can use Spring Boot configuration files.
The native options can be inspected as static fields in <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon/blob/master/ribbon-core/src/main/java/com/netflix/client/config/CommonClientConfigKey.java"><literal>CommonClientConfigKey</literal></link> (part of ribbon-core).</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud also lets you take full control of the client by declaring additional configuration (on top of the <literal>RibbonClientConfiguration</literal>) using <literal>@RibbonClient</literal>, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Configuration
@RibbonClient(name = "custom", configuration = CustomConfiguration.class)
public class TestConfiguration {
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In this case, the client is composed from the components already in <literal>RibbonClientConfiguration</literal>, together with any in <literal>CustomConfiguration</literal> (where the latter generally overrides the former).</simpara>
<warning>
<simpara>The <literal>CustomConfiguration</literal> clas must be a <literal>@Configuration</literal> class, but take care that it is not in a <literal>@ComponentScan</literal> for the main application context.
Otherwise, it is shared by all the <literal>@RibbonClients</literal>. If you use <literal>@ComponentScan</literal> (or <literal>@SpringBootApplication</literal>), you need to take steps to avoid it being included (for instance, you can put it in a separate, non-overlapping package or specify the packages to scan explicitly in the <literal>@ComponentScan</literal>).</simpara>

<section xml:id="_using_ribbon_with_eureka">
<title>Using Ribbon with Eureka</title>
<simpara>When Eureka is used in conjunction with Ribbon (that is, both are on the classpath), the <literal>ribbonServerList</literal> is overridden with an extension of <literal>DiscoveryEnabledNIWSServerList</literal>, which populates the list of servers from Eureka.
It also replaces the <literal>IPing</literal> interface with <literal>NIWSDiscoveryPing</literal>, which delegates to Eureka to determine if a server is up.
The <literal>ServerList</literal> that is installed by default is a <literal>DomainExtractingServerList</literal>. Its purpose is to make metadata available to the load balancer without using AWS AMI metadata (which is what Netflix relies on).
By default, the server list is constructed with <quote>zone</quote> information, as provided in the instance metadata (so, on the remote clients, set <literal>eureka.instance.metadataMap.zone</literal>).
If that is missing and if the <literal>approximateZoneFromHostname</literal> flag is set, it can use the domain name from the server hostname as a proxy for the zone.
Once the zone information is available, it can be used in a <literal>ServerListFilter</literal>.
By default, it is used to locate a server in the same zone as the client, because the default is a <literal>ZonePreferenceServerListFilter</literal>.
By default, the zone of the client is determined in the same way as the remote instances (that is, through <literal>eureka.instance.metadataMap.zone</literal>).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The orthodox <quote>archaius</quote> way to set the client zone is through a configuration property called "@zone".
If it is available, Spring Cloud uses that in preference to all other settings (note that the key must be quoted in YAML configuration).</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>If there is no other source of zone data, then a guess is made, based on the client configuration (as opposed to the instance configuration).
We take <literal>eureka.client.availabilityZones</literal>, which is a map from region name to a list of zones, and pull out the first zone for the instance&#8217;s own region (that is, the <literal>eureka.client.region</literal>, which defaults to "us-east-1", for compatibility with native Netflix).</simpara>

<simpara>You can provide some information that is used by your <literal>IRule</literal> implementation to choose a target server, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>RequestContext.getCurrentContext()
              .set(FilterConstants.LOAD_BALANCER_KEY, "canary-test");</screen>
<simpara>If you put any object into the <literal>RequestContext</literal> with a key of <literal>FilterConstants.LOAD_BALANCER_KEY</literal>, it is passed to the <literal>choose</literal> method of the  <literal>IRule</literal> implementation.
The code shown in the preceding example must be executed before <literal>RibbonRoutingFilter</literal> is executed.
Zuul&#8217;s pre filter is the best place to do that.
You can access HTTP headers and query parameters through the <literal>RequestContext</literal> in pre filter, so it can be used to determine the <literal>LOAD_BALANCER_KEY</literal> that is passed to Ribbon.
If you do not put any value with <literal>LOAD_BALANCER_KEY</literal> in <literal>RequestContext</literal>, null is passed as a parameter of the <literal>choose</literal> method.</simpara>

<title>External Configuration: Archaius</title>
<simpara><link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/archaius">Archaius</link> is the Netflix client-side configuration library.
It is the library used by all of the Netflix OSS components for configuration.
Archaius is an extension of the <link xl:href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-configuration">Apache Commons Configuration</link> project.
It allows updates to configuration by either polling a source for changes or by letting a source push changes to the client.
Archaius uses Dynamic&lt;Type&gt;Property classes as handles to properties, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Archaius Example</title>

<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">class ArchaiusTest {
    DynamicStringProperty myprop = DynamicPropertyFactory

    void doSomething() {
        OtherClass.someMethod(myprop.get());

}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Archaius has its own set of configuration files and loading priorities.
Spring applications should generally not use Archaius directly, but the need to configure the Netflix tools natively remains.
Spring Cloud has a Spring Environment Bridge so that Archaius can read properties from the Spring Environment.
This bridge allows Spring Boot projects to use the normal configuration toolchain while letting them configure the Netflix tools as documented (for the most part).</simpara>

</section>
<section xml:id="netflix-zuul-reverse-proxy">
<title>Embedded Zuul Reverse Proxy</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud has created an embedded Zuul proxy to ease the development of a common use case where a UI application wants to make proxy calls to one or more back end services.
This feature is useful for a user interface to proxy to the back end services it requires, avoiding the need to manage CORS and authentication concerns independently for all the back ends.</simpara>
<simpara>To enable it, annotate a Spring Boot main class with <literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal>. Doing so causes local calls to be forwarded to the appropriate service.
By convention, a service with an ID of <literal>users</literal> receives requests from the proxy located at <literal>/users</literal> (with the prefix stripped).
The proxy uses Ribbon to locate an instance to which to forward through discovery.
All requests are executed in a <link linkend="hystrix-fallbacks-for-routes">hystrix command</link>, so failures appear in Hystrix metrics.
Once the circuit is open, the proxy does not try to contact the service.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>the Zuul starter does not include a discovery client, so, for routes based on service IDs, you need to provide one of those on the classpath as well (Eureka is one choice).</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>To skip having a service automatically added, set <literal>zuul.ignored-services</literal> to a list of service ID patterns.
If a service matches a pattern that is ignored but is also included in the explicitly configured routes map, it is unignored, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  ignoredServices: '*'
  routes:
    users: /myusers/**</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>In the preceding example, all services are ignored, <emphasis role="strong">except</emphasis> for <literal>users</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To augment or change the proxy routes, you can add external configuration, as follows:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    users: /myusers/**</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>The preceding example means that HTTP calls to <literal>/myusers</literal> get forwarded to the <literal>users</literal> service (for example <literal>/myusers/101</literal> is forwarded to <literal>/101</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>To get more fine-grained control over a route, you can specify the path and the serviceId independently, as follows:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
      serviceId: users_service</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>The preceding example means that HTTP calls to <literal>/myusers</literal> get forwarded to the <literal>users_service</literal> service.
The route must have a <literal>path</literal> that can be specified as an ant-style pattern, so <literal>/myusers/*</literal> only matches one level, but <literal>/myusers/**</literal> matches hierarchically.</simpara>
<simpara>The location of the back end can be specified as either a <literal>serviceId</literal> (for a service from discovery) or a <literal>url</literal> (for a physical location), as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
      url: https://example.com/users_service</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>These simple url-routes do not get executed as a <literal>HystrixCommand</literal>, nor do they load-balance multiple URLs with Ribbon.
To achieve those goals, you can specify a <literal>serviceId</literal> with a static list of servers, as follows:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">zuul:
  routes:
    echo:
      path: /myusers/**
      serviceId: myusers-service
      stripPrefix: true

hystrix:
  command:
    myusers-service:
      execution:
        isolation:
          thread:
            timeoutInMilliseconds: ...

myusers-service:
  ribbon:
    NIWSServerListClassName: com.netflix.loadbalancer.ConfigurationBasedServerList
    listOfServers: https://example1.com,http://example2.com
    ConnectTimeout: 1000
    ReadTimeout: 3000
    MaxTotalHttpConnections: 500
    MaxConnectionsPerHost: 100</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Another method is specifiying a service-route and configuring a Ribbon client for the <literal>serviceId</literal> (doing so requires disabling Eureka support in Ribbon&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;see <link linkend="spring-cloud-ribbon-without-eureka">above for more information</link>), as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
      serviceId: users

ribbon:
  eureka:
    enabled: false

users:
  ribbon:
    listOfServers: example.com,google.com</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>You can provide a convention between <literal>serviceId</literal> and routes by using <literal>regexmapper</literal>.
It uses regular-expression named groups to extract variables from <literal>serviceId</literal> and inject them into a route pattern, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>ApplicationConfiguration.java</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public PatternServiceRouteMapper serviceRouteMapper() {
    return new PatternServiceRouteMapper(
        "(?&lt;name&gt;^.+)-(?&lt;version&gt;v.+$)",
        "${version}/${name}");
}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>The preceding example means that a <literal>serviceId</literal> of <literal>myusers-v1</literal> is mapped to route <literal>/v1/myusers/**</literal>.
Any regular expression is accepted, but all named groups must be present in both <literal>servicePattern</literal> and <literal>routePattern</literal>.
If <literal>servicePattern</literal> does not match a <literal>serviceId</literal>, the default behavior is used.
In the preceding example, a <literal>serviceId</literal> of <literal>myusers</literal> is mapped to the "/myusers/**" route (with no version detected).
This feature is disabled by default and only applies to discovered services.</simpara>
<simpara>To add a prefix to all mappings, set <literal>zuul.prefix</literal> to a value, such as <literal>/api</literal>.
By default, the proxy prefix is stripped from the request before the request is forwarded by (you can switch this behavior off with <literal>zuul.stripPrefix=false</literal>).
You can also switch off the stripping of the service-specific prefix from individual routes, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
      stripPrefix: false</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<note>
<simpara><literal>zuul.stripPrefix</literal> only applies to the prefix set in <literal>zuul.prefix</literal>.
It does not have any effect on prefixes defined within a given route&#8217;s <literal>path</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>In the preceding example, requests to <literal>/myusers/101</literal> are forwarded to <literal>/myusers/101</literal> on the <literal>users</literal> service.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>zuul.routes</literal> entries actually bind to an object of type <literal>ZuulProperties</literal>.
If you look at the properties of that object, you can see that it also has a <literal>retryable</literal> flag.
Set that flag to <literal>true</literal> to have the Ribbon client automatically retry failed requests.
You can also set that flag to <literal>true</literal> when you need to modify the parameters of the retry operations that use the Ribbon client configuration.</simpara>
<simpara>By default, the <literal>X-Forwarded-Host</literal> header is added to the forwarded requests.
To turn it off, set <literal>zuul.addProxyHeaders = false</literal>.
By default, the prefix path is stripped, and the request to the back end picks up a <literal>X-Forwarded-Prefix</literal> header (<literal>/myusers</literal> in the examples shown earlier).</simpara>
<simpara>If you set a default route (<literal>/</literal>), an application with <literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal> could act as a standalone server. For example, <literal>zuul.route.home: /</literal> would route all traffic ("/**") to the "home" service.</simpara>
<simpara>If more fine-grained ignoring is needed, you can specify specific patterns to ignore.
These patterns are evaluated at the start of the route location process, which means prefixes should be included in the pattern to warrant a match.
Ignored patterns span all services and supersede any other route specification.
The following example shows how to create ignored patterns:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  ignoredPatterns: /**/admin/**
  routes:
    users: /myusers/**</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>The preceding example means that all calls (such as <literal>/myusers/101</literal>) are forwarded to <literal>/101</literal> on the <literal>users</literal> service.
However, calls including <literal>/admin/</literal> do not resolve.</simpara>
<warning>
<simpara>If you need your routes to have their order preserved, you need to use a YAML file, as the ordering is lost when using a properties file.
The following example shows such a YAML file:</simpara>
</warning>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
    legacy:
      path: /**</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>If you were to use a properties file, the <literal>legacy</literal> path might end up in front of the <literal>users</literal>
path, rendering the <literal>users</literal> path unreachable.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_zuul_http_client">
<title>Zuul Http Client</title>
<simpara>The default HTTP client used by Zuul is now backed by the Apache HTTP Client instead of the deprecated Ribbon <literal>RestClient</literal>.
To use <literal>RestClient</literal> or <literal>okhttp3.OkHttpClient</literal>, set <literal>ribbon.restclient.enabled=true</literal> or <literal>ribbon.okhttp.enabled=true</literal>, respectively.
If you would like to customize the Apache HTTP client or the OK HTTP client, provide a bean of type <literal>ClosableHttpClient</literal> or <literal>OkHttpClient</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_cookies_and_sensitive_headers">
<title>Cookies and Sensitive Headers</title>
<simpara>You can share headers between services in the same system, but you probably do not want sensitive headers leaking downstream into external servers.
You can specify a list of ignored headers as part of the route configuration.
Cookies play a special role, because they have well defined semantics in browsers, and they are always to be treated as sensitive.
If the consumer of your proxy is a browser, then cookies for downstream services also cause problems for the user, because they all get jumbled up together (all downstream services look like they come from the same place).</simpara>
<simpara>If you are careful with the design of your services, (for example, if only one of the downstream services sets cookies), you might be able to let them flow from the back end all the way up to the caller.
Also, if your proxy sets cookies and all your back-end services are part of the same system, it can be natural to simply share them (and, for instance, use Spring Session to link them up to some shared state).
Other than that, any cookies that get set by downstream services are likely to be not useful to the caller, so it is recommended that you make (at least) <literal>Set-Cookie</literal> and <literal>Cookie</literal> into sensitive headers for routes that are not part of your domain.
Even for routes that are part of your domain, try to think carefully about what it means before letting cookies flow between them and the proxy.</simpara>
<simpara>The sensitive headers can be configured as a comma-separated list per route, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
      sensitiveHeaders: Cookie,Set-Cookie,Authorization
      url: https://downstream</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<note>
<simpara>This is the default value for <literal>sensitiveHeaders</literal>, so you need not set it unless you want it to be different.
This is new in Spring Cloud Netflix 1.1 (in 1.0, the user had no control over headers, and all cookies flowed in both directions).</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>The <literal>sensitiveHeaders</literal> are a blacklist, and the default is not empty.
Consequently, to make Zuul send all headers (except the <literal>ignored</literal> ones), you must explicitly set it to the empty list.
Doing so is necessary if you want to pass cookie or authorization headers to your back end. The following example shows how to use <literal>sensitiveHeaders</literal>:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
      sensitiveHeaders:
      url: https://downstream</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>You can also set sensitive headers, by setting <literal>zuul.sensitiveHeaders</literal>.
If <literal>sensitiveHeaders</literal> is set on a route, it overrides the global <literal>sensitiveHeaders</literal> setting.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_ignored_headers">
<title>Ignored Headers</title>
<simpara>In addition to the route-sensitive headers, you can set a global value called <literal>zuul.ignoredHeaders</literal> for values (both request and response) that should be discarded during interactions with downstream services.
By default, if Spring Security is not on the classpath, these are empty.
Otherwise, they are initialized to a set of well known <quote>security</quote> headers (for example, involving caching) as specified by Spring Security.
The assumption in this case is that the downstream services might add these headers, too, but we want the values from the proxy.
To not discard these well known security headers when Spring Security is on the classpath, you can set <literal>zuul.ignoreSecurityHeaders</literal> to <literal>false</literal>.
Doing so can be useful if you disabled the HTTP Security response headers in Spring Security and want the values provided by downstream services.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_management_endpoints">
<title>Management Endpoints</title>

</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="_strangulation_patterns_and_local_forwards">
<title>Strangulation Patterns and Local Forwards</title>
<simpara>A common pattern when migrating an existing application or API is to <quote>strangle</quote> old endpoints, slowly replacing them with different implementations.
The Zuul proxy is a useful tool for this because you can use it to handle all traffic from the clients of the old endpoints but redirect some of the requests to new ones.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows the configuration details for a <quote>strangle</quote> scenario:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    first:
      path: /first/**
      url: https://first.example.com
    second:
      path: /second/**
      url: forward:/second
    third:
      path: /third/**
      url: forward:/3rd
    legacy:
      path: /**
      url: https://legacy.example.com</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>In the preceding example, we are strangle the <quote>legacy</quote> application, which is mapped to all requests that do not match one of the other patterns.
Paths in <literal>/first/**</literal> have been extracted into a new service with an external URL.
Paths in <literal>/second/**</literal> are forwarded so that they can be handled locally (for example, with a normal Spring <literal>@RequestMapping</literal>).
Paths in <literal>/third/**</literal> are also forwarded but with a different prefix (<literal>/third/foo</literal> is forwarded to <literal>/3rd/foo</literal>).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The ignored patterns aren&#8217;t completely ignored, they just are not handled by the proxy (so they are also effectively forwarded locally).</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_uploading_files_through_zuul">
<title>Uploading Files through Zuul</title>
<simpara>If you use <literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal>, you can use the proxy paths to upload files and it should work, so long as the files are small.
For large files there is an alternative path that bypasses the Spring <literal>DispatcherServlet</literal> (to avoid multipart processing) in "/zuul/*".
In other words, if you have <literal>zuul.routes.customers=/customers/**</literal>, then you can <literal>POST</literal> large files to <literal>/zuul/customers/*</literal>.
The servlet path is externalized via <literal>zuul.servletPath</literal>.
If the proxy route takes you through a Ribbon load balancer, extremely large files also require elevated timeout settings, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">hystrix.command.default.execution.isolation.thread.timeoutInMilliseconds: 60000
ribbon:
  ConnectTimeout: 3000
  ReadTimeout: 60000</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Note that, for streaming to work with large files, you need to use chunked encoding in the request (which some browsers do not do by default), as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ curl -v -H "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" \
    -F "file=@mylarge.iso" localhost:9999/zuul/simple/file</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_query_string_encoding">
<title>Query String Encoding</title>
<simpara>When processing the incoming request, query params are decoded so that they can be available for possible modifications in Zuul filters.
They are then re-encoded the back end request is rebuilt in the route filters.
The result can be different than the original input if (for example) it was encoded with Javascript&#8217;s <literal>encodeURIComponent()</literal> method.
While this causes no issues in most cases, some web servers can be picky with the encoding of complex query string.</simpara>
<simpara>To force the original encoding of the query string, it is possible to pass a special flag to <literal>ZuulProperties</literal> so that the query string is taken as is with the <literal>HttpServletRequest::getQueryString</literal> method, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  forceOriginalQueryStringEncoding: true</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<note>
<simpara>This special flag works only with <literal>SimpleHostRoutingFilter</literal>. Also, you loose the ability to easily override
query parameters with <literal>RequestContext.getCurrentContext().setRequestQueryParams(someOverriddenParameters)</literal>, because
the query string is now fetched directly on the original <literal>HttpServletRequest</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_request_uri_encoding">
<title>Request URI Encoding</title>
<simpara>When processing the incoming request, request URI is decoded before matching them to routes.
The request URI is then re-encoded when the back end request is rebuilt in the route filters.
This can cause some unexpected behavior if your URI includes the encoded "/" character.</simpara>
<simpara>To use the original request URI, it is possible to pass a special flag to 'ZuulProperties' so that the URI will be taken as is with the <literal>HttpServletRequest::getRequestURI</literal> method, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  decodeUrl: false</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<note>
<simpara>If you are overriding request URI using <literal>requestURI</literal> RequestContext attribute and this flag is set to false, then the URL set in the request context will not be encoded. It will be your responsibility to make sure the URL is already encoded.</simpara>

<title>Plain Embedded Zuul</title>
<simpara>If you use <literal>@EnableZuulServer</literal> (instead of <literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal>), you can also run a Zuul server without proxying or selectively switch on parts of the proxying platform.
Any beans that you add to the application of type <literal>ZuulFilter</literal> are installed automatically (as they are with <literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal>) but without any of the proxy filters being added automatically.</simpara>
<simpara>In that case, the routes into the Zuul server are still specified by configuring "zuul.routes.*", but there is no service discovery and no proxying. Consequently, the "serviceId" and "url" settings are ignored.
The following example maps all paths in "/api/**" to the Zuul filter chain:</simpara>
<formalpara>

<title>Disable Zuul Filters</title>
<simpara>Zuul for Spring Cloud comes with a number of <literal>ZuulFilter</literal> beans enabled by default in both proxy and server mode.
See <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/tree/master/spring-cloud-netflix-zuul/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/netflix/zuul/filters">the Zuul filters package</link> for the list of filters that you can enable.
If you want to disable one, set <literal>zuul.&lt;SimpleClassName&gt;.&lt;filterType&gt;.disable=true</literal>.
By convention, the package after <literal>filters</literal> is the Zuul filter type.
For example to disable <literal>org.springframework.cloud.netflix.zuul.filters.post.SendResponseFilter</literal>, set <literal>zuul.SendResponseFilter.post.disable=true</literal>.</simpara>

<section xml:id="hystrix-fallbacks-for-routes">
<title>Providing Hystrix Fallbacks For Routes</title>
<simpara>When a circuit for a given route in Zuul is tripped, you can provide a fallback response by creating a bean of type <literal>FallbackProvider</literal>.
Within this bean, you need to specify the route ID the fallback is for and provide a <literal>ClientHttpResponse</literal> to return as a fallback.
The following example shows a relatively simple <literal>FallbackProvider</literal> implementation:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">class MyFallbackProvider implements FallbackProvider {

    @Override
    public String getRoute() {
        return "customers";
    }

    @Override
    public ClientHttpResponse fallbackResponse(String route, final Throwable cause) {
        if (cause instanceof HystrixTimeoutException) {
            return response(HttpStatus.GATEWAY_TIMEOUT);
        } else {
            return response(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
        }
    }

    private ClientHttpResponse response(final HttpStatus status) {
        return new ClientHttpResponse() {
            @Override
            public HttpStatus getStatusCode() throws IOException {
                return status;
            }

            @Override
            public int getRawStatusCode() throws IOException {
                return status.value();
            }

            @Override
            public String getStatusText() throws IOException {
                return status.getReasonPhrase();
            }

            @Override

                return headers;
            }
        };
    }

<simpara>The following example shows how the route configuration for the previous example might appear:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">zuul:
  routes:

<simpara>If you would like to provide a default fallback for all routes, you can create a bean of type <literal>FallbackProvider</literal> and have the <literal>getRoute</literal> method return <literal>*</literal> or <literal>null</literal>, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">class MyFallbackProvider implements FallbackProvider {

</section>
<section xml:id="zuul-redirect-location-rewrite">
<title>Rewriting the <literal>Location</literal> header</title>
<simpara>If Zuul is fronting a web application, you may need to re-write the <literal>Location</literal> header when the web application redirects through a HTTP status code of <literal>3XX</literal>.
Otherwise, the browser redirects to the web application&#8217;s URL instead of the Zuul URL.
You can configure a <literal>LocationRewriteFilter</literal> Zuul filter to re-write the <literal>Location</literal> header to the Zuul&#8217;s URL.
It also adds back the stripped global and route-specific prefixes.
The following example adds a filter by using a Spring Configuration file:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.zuul.filters.post.LocationRewriteFilter;
...

@Configuration
@EnableZuulProxy
public class ZuulConfig {
    @Bean
    public LocationRewriteFilter locationRewriteFilter() {
        return new LocationRewriteFilter();
    }
}</programlisting>
<caution>
<simpara>Use this filter carefully. The filter acts on the <literal>Location</literal> header of ALL <literal>3XX</literal> response codes, which may not be appropriate in all scenarios, such as when redirecting the user to an external URL.</simpara>
</caution>

<section xml:id="_enabling_cross_origin_requests">
<title>Enabling Cross Origin Requests</title>
<simpara>By default Zuul routes all Cross Origin requests (CORS) to the services. If you want instead Zuul to handle these requests it can be done by providing custom <literal>WebMvcConfigurer</literal> bean:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public WebMvcConfigurer corsConfigurer() {

                    .allowedMethods("GET", "POST");
        }
    };
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In the example above, we allow <literal>GET</literal> and <literal>POST</literal> methods from <literal><link xl:href="https://allowed-origin.com">https://allowed-origin.com</link></literal> to send cross-origin requests to the endpoints starting with <literal>path-1</literal>.
You can apply CORS configuration to a specific path pattern or globally for the whole application, using <literal>/**</literal> mapping.
You can customize properties: <literal>allowedOrigins</literal>,<literal>allowedMethods</literal>,<literal>allowedHeaders</literal>,<literal>exposedHeaders</literal>,<literal>allowCredentials</literal> and <literal>maxAge</literal> via this configuration.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_the_zuul_servlet">
<title>The Zuul Servlet</title>
<simpara>Zuul is implemented as a Servlet. For the general cases, Zuul is embedded into the Spring Dispatch mechanism. This lets Spring MVC be in control of the routing.
In this case, Zuul buffers requests.
If there is a need to go through Zuul without buffering requests (for example, for large file uploads), the Servlet is also installed outside of the Spring Dispatcher.
By default, the servlet has an address of <literal>/zuul</literal>.
This path can be changed with the <literal>zuul.servlet-path</literal> property.</simpara>

Its data is held in a <literal>ThreadLocal</literal> specific to each request.
Information about where to route requests, errors, and the actual <literal>HttpServletRequest</literal> and <literal>HttpServletResponse</literal> are stored there.
The <literal>RequestContext</literal> extends <literal>ConcurrentHashMap</literal>, so anything can be stored in the context. <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/blob/master/spring-cloud-netflix-zuul/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/netflix/zuul/filters/support/FilterConstants.java"><literal>FilterConstants</literal></link> contains the keys used by the filters installed by Spring Cloud Netflix (more on these <link linkend="zuul-developer-guide-enable-filters">later</link>).</simpara>

<section xml:id="zuul-developer-guide-sample-pre-filter">
<title>How to Write a Pre Filter</title>
<simpara>Pre filters set up data in the <literal>RequestContext</literal> for use in filters downstream.
The main use case is to set information required for route filters.
The following example shows a Zuul pre filter:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public class QueryParamPreFilter extends ZuulFilter {

<simpara>The preceding filter populates <literal>SERVICE_ID_KEY</literal> from the <literal>sample</literal> request parameter.
In practice, you should not do that kind of direct mapping. Instead, the service ID should be looked up from the value of <literal>sample</literal> instead.</simpara>

<title>Polyglot support with Sidecar</title>
<simpara>Do you have non-JVM languages with which you want to take advantage of Eureka, Ribbon, and Config Server?
The Spring Cloud Netflix Sidecar was inspired by <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/Prana">Netflix Prana</link>.
It includes an HTTP API to get all of the instances (by host and port) for a given service.
You can also proxy service calls through an embedded Zuul proxy that gets its route entries from Eureka.
The Spring Cloud Config Server can be accessed directly through host lookup or through the Zuul Proxy.
The non-JVM application should implement a health check so the Sidecar can report to Eureka whether the app is up or down.</simpara>
<simpara>To include Sidecar in your project, use the dependency with a group ID of <literal>org.springframework.cloud</literal>
and artifact ID or <literal>spring-cloud-netflix-sidecar</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To enable the Sidecar, create a Spring Boot application with <literal>@EnableSidecar</literal>.
This annotation includes <literal>@EnableCircuitBreaker</literal>, <literal>@EnableDiscoveryClient</literal>, and <literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal>.
Run the resulting application on the same host as the non-JVM application.</simpara>
<simpara>To configure the side car, add <literal>sidecar.port</literal> and <literal>sidecar.health-uri</literal> to <literal>application.yml</literal>.
The <literal>sidecar.port</literal> property is the port on which the non-JVM application listens.
This is so the Sidecar can properly register the application with Eureka.
The <literal>sidecar.secure-port-enabled</literal> options provides a way to enable secure port for traffic.
The <literal>sidecar.health-uri</literal> is a URI accessible on the non-JVM application that mimics a Spring Boot health indicator.
It should return a JSON document that resembles the following:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>health-uri-document</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{

<chapter xml:id="retrying-failed-requests">
<title>Retrying Failed Requests</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Netflix offers a variety of ways to make HTTP requests.
You can use a load balanced <literal>RestTemplate</literal>, Ribbon, or Feign.
No matter how you choose to create your HTTP requests, there is always a chance that a request may fail.
When a request fails, you may want to have the request be retried automatically.
To do so when using Sping Cloud Netflix, you need to include <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry">Spring Retry</link> on your application&#8217;s classpath.
When Spring Retry is present, load-balanced <literal>RestTemplates</literal>, Feign, and Zuul automatically retry any failed requests (assuming your configuration allows doing so).</simpara>
<section xml:id="_backoff_policies">
<title>BackOff Policies</title>
<simpara>By default, no backoff policy is used when retrying requests.
If you would like to configure a backoff policy, you need to create a bean of type <literal>LoadBalancedRetryFactory</literal> and override the <literal>createBackOffPolicy</literal> method for a given service, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {
    @Bean
    LoadBalancedRetryFactory retryFactory() {
        return new LoadBalancedRetryFactory() {
            @Override
            public BackOffPolicy createBackOffPolicy(String service) {
                return new ExponentialBackOffPolicy();
            }
        };
    }
}</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_configuration">
<title>Configuration</title>
<simpara>When you use Ribbon with Spring Retry, you can control the retry functionality by configuring certain Ribbon properties.
To do so, set the <literal>client.ribbon.MaxAutoRetries</literal>, <literal>client.ribbon.MaxAutoRetriesNextServer</literal>, and <literal>client.ribbon.OkToRetryOnAllOperations</literal> properties.
See the <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon/wiki/Getting-Started#the-properties-file-sample-clientproperties">Ribbon documentation</link> for a description of what these properties do.</simpara>
<warning>
<simpara>Enabling <literal>client.ribbon.OkToRetryOnAllOperations</literal> includes retrying POST requests, which can have an impact
on the server&#8217;s resources, due to the buffering of the request body.</simpara>
</warning>
<simpara>In addition, you may want to retry requests when certain status codes are returned in the response.
You can list the response codes you would like the Ribbon client to retry by setting the <literal>clientName.ribbon.retryableStatusCodes</literal> property, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">clientName:
  ribbon:
    retryableStatusCodes: 404,502</programlisting>
<simpara>You can also create a bean of type <literal>LoadBalancedRetryPolicy</literal> and implement the <literal>retryableStatusCode</literal> method to retry a request given the status code.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_zuul">
<title>Zuul</title>
<simpara>You can turn off Zuul&#8217;s retry functionality by setting <literal>zuul.retryable</literal> to <literal>false</literal>.
You can also disable retry functionality on a route-by-route basis by setting <literal>zuul.routes.routename.retryable</literal> to <literal>false</literal>.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_http_clients">
<title>HTTP Clients</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Netflix automatically creates the HTTP client used by Ribbon, Feign, and Zuul for you.
However, you can also provide your own HTTP clients customized as you need them to be.
To do so, you can create a bean of type <literal>ClosableHttpClient</literal> if you
are using the Apache Http Cient or <literal>OkHttpClient</literal> if you are using OK HTTP.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>When you create your own HTTP client, you are also responsible for implementing the correct connection management strategies for these clients.
Doing so improperly can result in resource management issues.</simpara>

<title>Declarative REST Client: Feign</title>
<simpara><link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/feign">Feign</link> is a declarative web service client.  It makes writing web service clients easier.  To use Feign create an interface and annotate it.  It has pluggable annotation support including Feign annotations and JAX-RS annotations. Feign also supports pluggable encoders and decoders.  Spring Cloud adds support for Spring MVC annotations and for using the same <literal>HttpMessageConverters</literal> used by default in Spring Web.  Spring Cloud integrates Ribbon and Eureka to provide a load balanced http client when using Feign.</simpara>
<section xml:id="netflix-feign-starter">
<title>How to Include Feign</title>

for details on setting up your build system with the current Spring Cloud Release Train.</simpara>
<simpara>Example spring boot app</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@EnableFeignClients
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);

<title>StoreClient.java</title>

    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value = "/stores")
    List&lt;Store&gt; getStores();

    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST, value = "/stores/{storeId}", consumes = "application/json")
    Store update(@PathVariable("storeId") Long storeId, Store store);
}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>In the <literal>@FeignClient</literal> annotation the String value ("stores" above) is
an arbitrary client name, which is used to create a Ribbon load
balancer (see <link linkend="spring-cloud-ribbon">below for details of Ribbon
support</link>). You can also specify a URL using the <literal>url</literal> attribute
(absolute value or just a hostname). The name of the bean in the
application context is the fully qualified name of the interface.
To specify your own alias value you can use the <literal>qualifier</literal> value
of the <literal>@FeignClient</literal> annotation.</simpara>
<simpara>The Ribbon client above will want to discover the physical addresses
for the "stores" service. If your application is a Eureka client then
it will resolve the service in the Eureka service registry. If you
don&#8217;t want to use Eureka, you can simply configure a list of servers
in your external configuration (see
<link linkend="spring-cloud-ribbon-without-eureka">above for example</link>).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="spring-cloud-feign-overriding-defaults">
<title>Overriding Feign Defaults</title>
<simpara>A central concept in Spring Cloud&#8217;s Feign support is that of the named client. Each feign client is part of an ensemble of components that work together to contact a remote server on demand, and the ensemble has a name that you give it as an application developer using the <literal>@FeignClient</literal> annotation. Spring Cloud creates a new ensemble as an
<literal>ApplicationContext</literal> on demand for each named client using <literal>FeignClientsConfiguration</literal>. This contains (amongst other things) an <literal>feign.Decoder</literal>, a <literal>feign.Encoder</literal>, and a <literal>feign.Contract</literal>.
It is possible to override the name of that ensemble by using the <literal>contextId</literal>
attribute of the <literal>@FeignClient</literal> annotation.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud lets you take full control of the feign client by declaring additional configuration (on top of the <literal>FeignClientsConfiguration</literal>) using <literal>@FeignClient</literal>. Example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@FeignClient(name = "stores", configuration = FooConfiguration.class)
public interface StoreClient {
    //..
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In this case the client is composed from the components already in <literal>FeignClientsConfiguration</literal> together with any in <literal>FooConfiguration</literal> (where the latter will override the former).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara><literal>FooConfiguration</literal> does not need to be annotated with <literal>@Configuration</literal>. However, if it is, then take care to exclude it from any <literal>@ComponentScan</literal> that would otherwise include this configuration as it will become the default source for <literal>feign.Decoder</literal>, <literal>feign.Encoder</literal>, <literal>feign.Contract</literal>, etc., when specified. This can be avoided by putting it in a separate, non-overlapping package from any <literal>@ComponentScan</literal> or <literal>@SpringBootApplication</literal>, or it can be explicitly excluded in <literal>@ComponentScan</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>The <literal>serviceId</literal> attribute is now deprecated in favor of the <literal>name</literal> attribute.</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>Using <literal>contextId</literal> attribute of the <literal>@FeignClient</literal> annotation in addition to changing the name of
the <literal>ApplicationContext</literal> ensemble, it will override the alias of the client name
and it will be used as part of the name of the configuration bean created for that client.</simpara>
</note>
<warning>
<simpara>Previously, using the <literal>url</literal> attribute, did not require the <literal>name</literal> attribute. Using <literal>name</literal> is now required.</simpara>
</warning>
<simpara>Placeholders are supported in the <literal>name</literal> and <literal>url</literal> attributes.</simpara>

<simpara>The OkHttpClient and ApacheHttpClient feign clients can be used by setting <literal>feign.okhttp.enabled</literal> or <literal>feign.httpclient.enabled</literal> to <literal>true</literal>, respectively, and having them on the classpath.
You can customize the HTTP client used by providing a bean of either <literal>ClosableHttpClient</literal> when using Apache or <literal>OkHttpClient</literal> when using OK HTTP.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Netflix <emphasis>does not</emphasis> provide the following beans by default for feign, but still looks up beans of these types from the application context to create the feign client:</simpara>

</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Creating a bean of one of those type and placing it in a <literal>@FeignClient</literal> configuration (such as <literal>FooConfiguration</literal> above) allows you to override each one of the beans described.  Example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Configuration
public class FooConfiguration {

    public BasicAuthRequestInterceptor basicAuthRequestInterceptor() {
        return new BasicAuthRequestInterceptor("user", "password");
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>This replaces the <literal>SpringMvcContract</literal> with <literal>feign.Contract.Default</literal> and adds a <literal>RequestInterceptor</literal> to the collection of <literal>RequestInterceptor</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>@FeignClient</literal> also can be configured using configuration properties.</simpara>
<simpara>application.yml</simpara>

<simpara>Default configurations can be specified in the <literal>@EnableFeignClients</literal> attribute <literal>defaultConfiguration</literal> in a similar manner as described above. The difference is that this configuration will apply to <emphasis>all</emphasis> feign clients.</simpara>
<simpara>If you prefer using configuration properties to configured all <literal>@FeignClient</literal>, you can create configuration properties with <literal>default</literal> feign name.</simpara>
<simpara>application.yml</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">feign:

<simpara>If we create both <literal>@Configuration</literal> bean and configuration properties, configuration properties will win.
It will override <literal>@Configuration</literal> values. But if you want to change the priority to <literal>@Configuration</literal>,
you can change <literal>feign.client.default-to-properties</literal> to <literal>false</literal>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>If you need to use <literal>ThreadLocal</literal> bound variables in your <literal>RequestInterceptor`s you will need to either set the

mapping is not inherited).</simpara>

<section xml:id="_feign_requestresponse_compression">
<title>Feign request/response compression</title>
<simpara>You may consider enabling the request or response GZIP compression for your
Feign requests. You can do this by enabling one of the properties:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">feign.compression.request.enabled=true
feign.compression.response.enabled=true</programlisting>
<simpara>Feign request compression gives you settings similar to what you may set for your web server:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">feign.compression.request.enabled=true
feign.compression.request.mime-types=text/xml,application/xml,application/json
feign.compression.request.min-request-size=2048</programlisting>
<simpara>These properties allow you to be selective about the compressed media types and minimum request threshold length.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_feign_logging">
<title>Feign logging</title>
<simpara>A logger is created for each Feign client created. By default the name of the logger is the full class name of the interface used to create the Feign client. Feign logging only responds to the <literal>DEBUG</literal> level.</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">logging.level.project.user.UserClient: DEBUG</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>The <literal>Logger.Level</literal> object that you may configure per client, tells Feign how much to log. Choices are:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>NONE</literal>, No logging (<emphasis role="strong">DEFAULT</emphasis>).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>BASIC</literal>, Log only the request method and URL and the response status code and execution time.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>HEADERS</literal>, Log the basic information along with request and response headers.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>FULL</literal>, Log the headers, body, and metadata for both requests and responses.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>For example, the following would set the <literal>Logger.Level</literal> to <literal>FULL</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Configuration
public class FooConfiguration {
    @Bean
    Logger.Level feignLoggerLevel() {

<section xml:id="_feign_querymap_support">
<title>Feign @QueryMap support</title>
<simpara>The OpenFeign <literal>@QueryMap</literal> annotation provides support for POJOs to be used as
GET parameter maps. Unfortunately, the default OpenFeign QueryMap annotation is
incompatible with Spring because it lacks a <literal>value</literal> property.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud OpenFeign provides an equivalent <literal>@SpringQueryMap</literal> annotation, which
is used to annotate a POJO or Map parameter as a query parameter map.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, the <literal>Params</literal> class defines parameters <literal>param1</literal> and <literal>param2</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// Params.java
public class Params {
    private String param1;
    private String param2;

    // [Getters and setters omitted for brevity]
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The following feign client uses the <literal>Params</literal> class by using the <literal>@SpringQueryMap</literal> annotation:</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_a_brief_history_of_springs_data_integration_journey">
<title>A Brief History of Spring&#8217;s Data Integration Journey</title>
<simpara>Spring&#8217;s journey on Data Integration started with <link xl:href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-integration/">Spring Integration</link>. With its programming model, it provided a consistent developer experience to build applications that can embrace <link xl:href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/">Enterprise Integration Patterns</link> to connect with external systems such as, databases, message brokers, and among others.</simpara>
<simpara>Fast forward to the cloud-era, where microservices have become prominent in the enterprise setting. <link xl:href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</link> transformed the way how developers built Applications. With Spring&#8217;s programming model and the runtime responsibilities handled by Spring Boot, it became seamless to develop stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based microservices.</simpara>
<simpara>To extend this to Data Integration workloads, Spring Integration and Spring Boot were put together into a new project. Spring Cloud Stream was born.</simpara>
<simpara>With Spring Cloud Stream, developers can:
* Build, test, iterate, and deploy data-centric applications in isolation.
* Apply modern microservices architecture patterns, including composition through messaging.
* Decouple application responsibilities with event-centric thinking. An event can represent something that has happened in time, to which the downstream consumer applications can react without knowing where it originated or the producer&#8217;s identity.
* Port the business logic onto message brokers (such as RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis).
* Interoperate between channel-based and non-channel-based application binding scenarios to support stateless and stateful computations by using Project Reactor&#8217;s Flux and Kafka Streams APIs.
* Rely on the framework&#8217;s automatic content-type support for common use-cases. Extending to different data conversion types is possible.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_quick_start_2">
<title>Quick Start</title>
<simpara>You can try Spring Cloud Stream in less then 5 min even before you jump into any details by following this three-step guide.</simpara>
<simpara>We show you how to create a Spring Cloud Stream application that receives messages coming from the messaging middleware of your choice (more on this later) and logs received messages to the console.
We call it <literal>LoggingConsumer</literal>.
While not very practical, it provides a good introduction to some of the main concepts
and abstractions, making it easier to digest the rest of this user guide.</simpara>
<simpara>The three steps are as follows:</simpara>

<section xml:id="spring-cloud-stream-preface-creating-sample-application">
<title>Creating a Sample Application by Using Spring Initializr</title>
<simpara>To get started, visit the <link xl:href="https://start.spring.io">Spring Initializr</link>. From there, you can generate our <literal>LoggingConsumer</literal> application. To do so:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>In the <emphasis role="strong">Dependencies</emphasis> section, start typing <literal>stream</literal>.
When the <quote>Cloud Stream</quote> option should appears, select it.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Start typing either 'kafka' or 'rabbit'.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Select <quote>Kafka</quote> or <quote>RabbitMQ</quote>.</simpara>
<simpara>Basically, you choose the messaging middleware to which your application binds.
We recommend using the one you have already installed or feel more comfortable with installing and running.
Also, as you can see from the Initilaizer screen, there are a few other options you can choose.
For example, you can choose Gradle as your build tool instead of Maven (the default).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>In the <emphasis role="strong">Artifact</emphasis> field, type 'logging-consumer'.</simpara>
<simpara>The value of the <emphasis role="strong">Artifact</emphasis> field becomes the application name.
If you chose RabbitMQ for the middleware, your Spring Initializr should now be as follows:</simpara>
<informalfigure>

</imageobject>
<textobject><phrase>stream initializr</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</informalfigure>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Click the <emphasis role="strong">Generate Project</emphasis> button.</simpara>
<simpara>Doing so downloads the zipped version of the generated project to your hard drive.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Unzip the file into the folder you want to use as your project directory.</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<tip>
<simpara>We encourage you to explore the many possibilities available in the Spring Initializr.
It lets you create many different kinds of Spring applications.</simpara>
</tip>
</section>
<section xml:id="spring-cloud-stream-preface-importing-project">
<title>Importing the Project into Your IDE</title>
<simpara>Now you can import the project into your IDE.
Keep in mind that, depending on the IDE, you may need to follow a specific import procedure.
For example, depending on how the project was generated (Maven or Gradle), you may need to follow specific import procedure (for example, in Eclipse or STS, you need to use File &#8594; Import &#8594; Maven &#8594; Existing Maven Project).</simpara>
<simpara>Once imported, the project must have no errors of any kind. Also, <literal>src/main/java</literal> should contain <literal>com.example.loggingconsumer.LoggingConsumerApplication</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Technically, at this point, you can run the application&#8217;s main class.
It is already a valid Spring Boot application.
However, it does not do anything, so we want to add some code.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="spring-cloud-stream-preface-adding-message-handler">
<title>Adding a Message Handler, Building, and Running</title>
<simpara>Modify the <literal>com.example.loggingconsumer.LoggingConsumerApplication</literal> class to look as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public class LoggingConsumerApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(LoggingConsumerApplication.class, args);
	}

	@StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)
	public void handle(Person person) {
		System.out.println("Received: " + person);
	}

	public static class Person {
		private String name;
		public String getName() {
			return name;
		}
		public void setName(String name) {
			this.name = name;
		}
		public String toString() {
			return this.name;
		}
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>As you can see from the preceding listing:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>We have enabled <literal>Sink</literal> binding (input-no-output) by using <literal>@EnableBinding(Sink.class)</literal>.
Doing so signals to the framework to initiate binding to the messaging middleware, where it automatically creates the destination (that is, queue, topic, and others) that are bound to the <literal>Sink.INPUT</literal> channel.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>We have added a <literal>handler</literal> method to receive incoming messages of type <literal>Person</literal>.
Doing so lets you see one of the core features of the framework: It tries to automatically convert incoming message payloads to type <literal>Person</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>You now have a fully functional Spring Cloud Stream application that does listens for messages.
From here, for simplicity, we assume you selected RabbitMQ in <link linkend="spring-cloud-stream-preface-creating-sample-application">step one</link>.
Assuming you have RabbitMQ installed and running, you can start the application by running its <literal>main</literal> method in your IDE.</simpara>
<simpara>You should see following output:</simpara>
<screen>	--- [ main] c.s.b.r.p.RabbitExchangeQueueProvisioner : declaring queue for inbound: input.anonymous.CbMIwdkJSBO1ZoPDOtHtCg, bound to: input
	--- [ main] o.s.a.r.c.CachingConnectionFactory       : Attempting to connect to: [localhost:5672]
	--- [ main] o.s.a.r.c.CachingConnectionFactory       : Created new connection: rabbitConnectionFactory#2a3a299:0/SimpleConnection@66c83fc8. . .
	. . .
	--- [ main] o.s.i.a.i.AmqpInboundChannelAdapter      : started inbound.input.anonymous.CbMIwdkJSBO1ZoPDOtHtCg
	. . .
	--- [ main] c.e.l.LoggingConsumerApplication         : Started LoggingConsumerApplication in 2.531 seconds (JVM running for 2.897)</screen>
<simpara>Go to the RabbitMQ management console or any other RabbitMQ client and send a message to <literal>input.anonymous.CbMIwdkJSBO1ZoPDOtHtCg</literal>.
The <literal>anonymous.CbMIwdkJSBO1ZoPDOtHtCg</literal> part represents the group name and is generated, so it is bound to be different in your environment.
For something more predictable, you can use an explicit group name by setting <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.group=hello</literal> (or whatever name you like).</simpara>
<simpara>The contents of the message should be a JSON representation of the <literal>Person</literal> class, as follows:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">{"name":"Sam Spade"}</literallayout>
<simpara>Then, in your console, you should see:</simpara>
<simpara><literal>Received: Sam Spade</literal></simpara>
<simpara>You can also build and package your application into a boot jar (by using <literal>./mvnw clean install</literal>) and run the built JAR by using the <literal>java -jar</literal> command.</simpara>
<simpara>Now you have a working (albeit very basic) Spring Cloud Stream application.</simpara>

<simpara>This section goes into more detail about how you can work with Spring Cloud Stream.
It covers topics such as creating and running stream applications.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="spring-cloud-stream-overview-introducing">
<title>Introducing Spring Cloud Stream</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building message-driven microservice applications.
Spring Cloud Stream builds upon Spring Boot to create standalone, production-grade Spring applications and uses Spring Integration to provide connectivity to message brokers.
It provides opinionated configuration of middleware from several vendors, introducing the concepts of persistent publish-subscribe semantics, consumer groups, and partitions.</simpara>
<simpara>You can add the <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> annotation to your application to get immediate connectivity to a message broker, and you can add <literal>@StreamListener</literal> to a method to cause it to receive events for stream processing.
The following example shows a sink application that receives external messages:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public class VoteRecordingSinkApplication {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(VoteRecordingSinkApplication.class, args);
  }

  @StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)
  public void processVote(Vote vote) {
      votingService.recordVote(vote);
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> annotation takes one or more interfaces as parameters (in this case, the parameter is a single <literal>Sink</literal> interface).
An interface declares input and output channels.
Spring Cloud Stream provides the <literal>Source</literal>, <literal>Sink</literal>, and <literal>Processor</literal> interfaces. You can also define your own interfaces.</simpara>
<simpara>The following listing shows the definition of the <literal>Sink</literal> interface:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface Sink {
  String INPUT = "input";

  @Input(Sink.INPUT)
  SubscribableChannel input();
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>@Input</literal> annotation identifies an input channel, through which received messages enter the application.
The <literal>@Output</literal> annotation identifies an output channel, through which published messages leave the application.
The <literal>@Input</literal> and <literal>@Output</literal> annotations can take a channel name as a parameter.
If a name is not provided, the name of the annotated method is used.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream creates an implementation of the interface for you.
You can use this in the application by autowiring it, as shown in the following example (from a test case):</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@SpringApplicationConfiguration(classes = VoteRecordingSinkApplication.class)
@WebAppConfiguration
@DirtiesContext
public class StreamApplicationTests {

  @Autowired
  private Sink sink;

  @Test
  public void contextLoads() {
    assertNotNull(this.sink.input());
  }
}</programlisting>

<title>The Binder Abstraction</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides Binder implementations for <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka">Kafka</link> and <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit">Rabbit MQ</link>.
Spring Cloud Stream also includes a <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/blob/master/spring-cloud-stream-test-support/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/stream/test/binder/TestSupportBinder.java">TestSupportBinder</link>, which leaves a channel unmodified so that tests can interact with channels directly and reliably assert on what is received.
You can also use the extensible API to write your own Binder.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream uses Spring Boot for configuration, and the Binder abstraction makes it possible for a Spring Cloud Stream application to be flexible in how it connects to middleware.
For example, deployers can dynamically choose, at runtime, the destinations (such as the Kafka topics or RabbitMQ exchanges) to which channels connect.
Such configuration can be provided through external configuration properties and in any form supported by Spring Boot (including application arguments, environment variables, and <literal>application.yml</literal> or <literal>application.properties</literal> files).
In the sink example from the <xref linkend="spring-cloud-stream-overview-introducing"/> section, setting the <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination</literal> application property to <literal>raw-sensor-data</literal> causes it to read from the <literal>raw-sensor-data</literal> Kafka topic or from a queue bound to the <literal>raw-sensor-data</literal> RabbitMQ exchange.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream automatically detects and uses a binder found on the classpath.
You can use different types of middleware with the same code.
To do so, include a different binder at build time.
For more complex use cases, you can also package multiple binders with your application and have it choose the binder( and even whether to use different binders for different channels) at runtime.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="spring-cloud-stream-overview-persistent-publish-subscribe-support">
<title>Persistent Publish-Subscribe Support</title>
<simpara>Communication between applications follows a publish-subscribe model, where data is broadcast through shared topics.
This can be seen in the following figure, which shows a typical deployment for a set of interacting Spring Cloud Stream applications.</simpara>
<figure>
<title>Spring Cloud Stream Publish-Subscribe</title>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/SCSt-sensors.png" width="75%" align="center"/>
</imageobject>
<textobject><phrase>SCSt sensors</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>Data reported by sensors to an HTTP endpoint is sent to a common destination named <literal>raw-sensor-data</literal>.
From the destination, it is independently processed by a microservice application that computes time-windowed averages and by another microservice application that ingests the raw data into HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System).
In order to process the data, both applications declare the topic as their input at runtime.</simpara>
<simpara>The publish-subscribe communication model reduces the complexity of both the producer and the consumer and lets new applications be added to the topology without disruption of the existing flow.
For example, downstream from the average-calculating application, you can add an application that calculates the highest temperature values for display and monitoring.
You can then add another application that interprets the same flow of averages for fault detection.
Doing all communication through shared topics rather than point-to-point queues reduces coupling between microservices.</simpara>
<simpara>While the concept of publish-subscribe messaging is not new, Spring Cloud Stream takes the extra step of making it an opinionated choice for its application model.
By using native middleware support, Spring Cloud Stream also simplifies use of the publish-subscribe model across different platforms.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="consumer-groups">
<title>Consumer Groups</title>
<simpara>While the publish-subscribe model makes it easy to connect applications through shared topics, the ability to scale up by creating multiple instances of a given application is equally important.
When doing so, different instances of an application are placed in a competing consumer relationship, where only one of the instances is expected to handle a given message.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream models this behavior through the concept of a consumer group.
(Spring Cloud Stream consumer groups are similar to and inspired by Kafka consumer groups.)
Each consumer binding can use the <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.&lt;channelName&gt;.group</literal> property to specify a group name.
For the consumers shown in the following figure, this property would be set as <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.&lt;channelName&gt;.group=hdfsWrite</literal> or <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.&lt;channelName&gt;.group=average</literal>.</simpara>

</imageobject>
<textobject><phrase>SCSt groups</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>All groups that subscribe to a given destination receive a copy of published data, but only one member of each group receives a given message from that destination.
By default, when a group is not specified, Spring Cloud Stream assigns the application to an anonymous and independent single-member consumer group that is in a publish-subscribe relationship with all other consumer groups.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="consumer-types">
<title>Consumer Types</title>
<simpara>Two types of consumer are supported:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Message-driven (sometimes referred to as Asynchronous)</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Polled (sometimes referred to as Synchronous)</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Prior to version 2.0, only asynchronous consumers were supported. A message is delivered as soon as it is available and a thread is available to process it.</simpara>
<simpara>When you wish to control the rate at which messages are processed, you might want to use a synchronous consumer.</simpara>
<section xml:id="durability">
<title>Durability</title>
<simpara>Consistent with the opinionated application model of Spring Cloud Stream, consumer group subscriptions are durable.
That is, a binder implementation ensures that group subscriptions are persistent and that, once at least one subscription for a group has been created, the group receives messages, even if they are sent while all applications in the group are stopped.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Anonymous subscriptions are non-durable by nature.
For some binder implementations (such as RabbitMQ), it is possible to have non-durable group subscriptions.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>In general, it is preferable to always specify a consumer group when binding an application to a given destination.
When scaling up a Spring Cloud Stream application, you must specify a consumer group for each of its input bindings.
Doing so prevents the application&#8217;s instances from receiving duplicate messages (unless that behavior is desired, which is unusual).</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="partitioning">
<title>Partitioning Support</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides support for partitioning data between multiple instances of a given application.
In a partitioned scenario, the physical communication medium (such as the broker topic) is viewed as being structured into multiple partitions.
One or more producer application instances send data to multiple consumer application instances and ensure that data identified by common characteristics are processed by the same consumer instance.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides a common abstraction for implementing partitioned processing use cases in a uniform fashion.
Partitioning can thus be used whether the broker itself is naturally partitioned (for example, Kafka) or not (for example, RabbitMQ).</simpara>
<figure>

<imagedata fileref="images/SCSt-partitioning.png" width="75%" align="center"/>
</imageobject>
<textobject><phrase>SCSt partitioning</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>Partitioning is a critical concept in stateful processing, where it is critical (for either performance or consistency reasons) to ensure that all related data is processed together.
For example, in the time-windowed average calculation example, it is important that all measurements from any given sensor are processed by the same application instance.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>To set up a partitioned processing scenario, you must configure both the data-producing and the data-consuming ends.</simpara>

</informalfigure>
<section xml:id="_destination_binders">
<title>Destination Binders</title>
<simpara>Destination Binders are extension components of Spring Cloud Stream responsible for providing the necessary configuration and implementation to facilitate
integration with external messaging systems.
This integration is responsible for connectivity, delegation, and routing of messages to and from producers and consumers, data type conversion,
invocation of the user code, and more.</simpara>
<simpara>Binders handle a lot of the boiler plate responsibilities that would otherwise fall on your shoulders. However, to accomplish that, the binder still needs
some help in the form of minimalistic yet required set of instructions from the user, which typically come in the form of some type of configuration.</simpara>
<simpara>While it is out of scope of this section to discuss all of the available binder and binding configuration options (the rest of the manual covers them extensively),
<emphasis>Destination Binding</emphasis> does require special attention. The next section discusses it in detail.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_destination_bindings">
<title>Destination Bindings</title>
<simpara>As stated earlier, <emphasis>Destination Bindings</emphasis> provide a bridge between the external messaging system and application-provided <emphasis>Producers</emphasis> and <emphasis>Consumers</emphasis>.</simpara>
<simpara>Applying the @EnableBinding annotation to one of the application’s configuration classes defines a destination binding.
The <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> annotation itself is meta-annotated with <literal>@Configuration</literal> and triggers the configuration of the Spring Cloud Stream infrastructure.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows a fully configured and functioning Spring Cloud Stream application that receives the payload of the message from the <literal>INPUT</literal>
destination as a <literal>String</literal> type (see <xref linkend="content-type-management"/> section), logs it to the console and sends it to the <literal>OUTPUT</literal> destination after converting it to upper case.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
public class MyApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
	}

	@StreamListener(Processor.INPUT)
	@SendTo(Processor.OUTPUT)
	public String handle(String value) {
		System.out.println("Received: " + value);
		return value.toUpperCase();
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>As you can see the <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> annotation can take one or more interface classes as parameters. The parameters are referred to as <emphasis>bindings</emphasis>,
and they contain methods representing <emphasis>bindable components</emphasis>.
These components are typically message channels (see <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-messaging.html">Spring Messaging</link>)
for channel-based binders (such as Rabbit, Kafka, and others). However other types of bindings can
provide support for the native features of the corresponding technology. For example Kafka Streams binder (formerly known as KStream) allows native bindings directly to Kafka Streams
(see <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/autorepo/docs/spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka-docs/1.1.0.M1/reference/htmlsingle/">Kafka Streams</link> for more details).</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream already provides <emphasis>binding</emphasis> interfaces for typical message exchange contracts, which include:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Sink:</emphasis> Identifies the contract for the message consumer by providing the destination from which the message is consumed.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Source:</emphasis> Identifies the contract for the message producer by providing the destination to which the produced message is sent.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Processor:</emphasis> Encapsulates both the sink and the source contracts by exposing two destinations that allow consumption and production of messages.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface Sink {

  String INPUT = "input";

  @Input(Sink.INPUT)
  SubscribableChannel input();
}</programlisting>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface Source {

  String OUTPUT = "output";

  @Output(Source.OUTPUT)
  MessageChannel output();
}</programlisting>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface Processor extends Source, Sink {}</programlisting>
<simpara>While the preceding example satisfies the majority of cases, you can also define your own contracts by defining your own bindings interfaces and use <literal>@Input</literal> and <literal>@Output</literal>
annotations to identify the actual <emphasis>bindable components</emphasis>.</simpara>
<simpara>For example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface Barista {

    @Input
    SubscribableChannel orders();

    @Output
    MessageChannel hotDrinks();

    @Output
    MessageChannel coldDrinks();
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Using the interface shown in the preceding example as a parameter to <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> triggers the creation of the three bound channels named <literal>orders</literal>, <literal>hotDrinks</literal>, and <literal>coldDrinks</literal>,
respectively.</simpara>
<simpara>You can provide as many binding interfaces as you need, as arguments to the <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> annotation, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(value = { Orders.class, Payment.class })</programlisting>
<simpara>In Spring Cloud Stream, the bindable <literal>MessageChannel</literal> components are the Spring Messaging <literal>MessageChannel</literal> (for outbound) and its extension, <literal>SubscribableChannel</literal>,
(for inbound).</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Pollable Destination Binding</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>While the previously described bindings support event-based message consumption, sometimes you need more control, such as rate of consumption.</simpara>
<simpara>Starting with version 2.0, you can now bind a pollable consumer:</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows how to bind a pollable consumer:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface PolledBarista {

    @Input
    PollableMessageSource orders();
	. . .
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In this case, an implementation of <literal>PollableMessageSource</literal> is bound to the <literal>orders</literal> “channel”. See <xref linkend="spring-cloud-streams-overview-using-polled-consumers"/> for more details.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Customizing Channel Names</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>By using the <literal>@Input</literal> and <literal>@Output</literal> annotations, you can specify a customized channel name for the channel, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface Barista {
    @Input("inboundOrders")
    SubscribableChannel orders();
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In the preceding example, the created bound channel is named <literal>inboundOrders</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Normally, you need not access individual channels or bindings directly  (other then configuring them via <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> annotation). However there may be
times, such as testing or other corner cases, when you do.</simpara>
<simpara>Aside from generating channels for each binding and registering them as Spring beans, for each bound interface, Spring Cloud Stream generates a bean that implements the interface.
That means you can have access to the interfaces representing the bindings or individual channels by auto-wiring either in your application, as shown in the following two examples:</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis>Autowire Binding interface</emphasis></simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowire
private Source source

public void sayHello(String name) {
    source.output().send(MessageBuilder.withPayload(name).build());
}</programlisting>
<simpara><emphasis>Autowire individual channel</emphasis></simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowire
private MessageChannel output;

public void sayHello(String name) {
    output.send(MessageBuilder.withPayload(name).build());
}</programlisting>
<simpara>You can also use standard Spring&#8217;s <literal>@Qualifier</literal> annotation for cases when channel names are customized or in multiple-channel scenarios that require specifically named channels.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows how to use the @Qualifier annotation in this way:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowire
@Qualifier("myChannel")
private MessageChannel output;</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="spring-cloud-stream-overview-producing-consuming-messages">
<title>Producing and Consuming Messages</title>
<simpara>You can write a Spring Cloud Stream application by using either Spring Integration annotations or Spring Cloud Stream native annotation.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_spring_integration_support">
<title>Spring Integration Support</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream is built on the concepts and patterns defined by <link xl:href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/">Enterprise Integration Patterns</link> and relies
in its internal implementation on an already established and popular implementation of Enterprise Integration Patterns within the Spring portfolio of projects:
<link xl:href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-integration/">Spring Integration</link> framework.</simpara>
<simpara>So its only natural for it to support the foundation, semantics, and configuration options that are already established by Spring Integration</simpara>
<simpara>For example, you can attach the output channel of a <literal>Source</literal> to a <literal>MessageSource</literal> and use the familiar <literal>@InboundChannelAdapter</literal> annotation, as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Source.class)
public class TimerSource {

  @Bean
  @InboundChannelAdapter(value = Source.OUTPUT, poller = @Poller(fixedDelay = "10", maxMessagesPerPoll = "1"))
  public MessageSource&lt;String&gt; timerMessageSource() {
    return () -&gt; new GenericMessage&lt;&gt;("Hello Spring Cloud Stream");
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Similarly, you can use @Transformer or @ServiceActivator while providing an implementation of a message handler method for a <emphasis>Processor</emphasis> binding contract, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
public class TransformProcessor {
  @Transformer(inputChannel = Processor.INPUT, outputChannel = Processor.OUTPUT)
  public Object transform(String message) {
    return message.toUpperCase();
  }
}</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>While this may be skipping ahead a bit, it is important to understand that, when you consume from the same binding using <literal>@StreamListener</literal> annotation, a pub-sub model is used.
Each method annotated with <literal>@StreamListener</literal> receives its own copy of a message, and each one has its own consumer group.
However, if you consume from the same binding by using one of the Spring Integration annotation (such as <literal>@Aggregator</literal>, <literal>@Transformer</literal>, or <literal>@ServiceActivator</literal>), those consume in a competing model.
No individual consumer group is created for each subscription.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_using_streamlistener_annotation">
<title>Using @StreamListener Annotation</title>
<simpara>Complementary to its Spring Integration support, Spring Cloud Stream provides its own <literal>@StreamListener</literal> annotation, modeled after other Spring Messaging annotations
(<literal>@MessageMapping</literal>, <literal>@JmsListener</literal>, <literal>@RabbitListener</literal>, and others) and provides conviniences, such as content-based routing and others.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public class VoteHandler {

  @Autowired
  VotingService votingService;

  @StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)
  public void handle(Vote vote) {
    votingService.record(vote);
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>As with other Spring Messaging methods, method arguments can be annotated with <literal>@Payload</literal>, <literal>@Headers</literal>, and <literal>@Header</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>For methods that return data, you must use the <literal>@SendTo</literal> annotation to specify the output binding destination for data returned by the method, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
public class TransformProcessor {

  @Autowired
  VotingService votingService;

  @StreamListener(Processor.INPUT)
  @SendTo(Processor.OUTPUT)
  public VoteResult handle(Vote vote) {
    return votingService.record(vote);
  }
}</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_using_streamlistener_for_content_based_routing">
<title>Using @StreamListener for Content-based routing</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream supports dispatching messages to multiple handler methods annotated with <literal>@StreamListener</literal> based on conditions.</simpara>
<simpara>In order to be eligible to support conditional dispatching, a method must satisfy the follow conditions:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>It must not return a value.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>It must be an individual message handling method (reactive API methods are not supported).</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The condition is specified by a SpEL expression in the <literal>condition</literal> argument of the annotation and is evaluated for each message.
All the handlers that match the condition are invoked in the same thread, and no assumption must be made about the order in which the invocations take place.</simpara>
<simpara>In the following example of a <literal>@StreamListener</literal> with dispatching conditions, all the messages bearing a header <literal>type</literal> with the value <literal>bogey</literal> are dispatched to the
<literal>receiveBogey</literal> method, and all the messages bearing a header <literal>type</literal> with the value <literal>bacall</literal> are dispatched to the <literal>receiveBacall</literal> method.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class TestPojoWithAnnotatedArguments {

    @StreamListener(target = Sink.INPUT, condition = "headers['type']=='bogey'")
    public void receiveBogey(@Payload BogeyPojo bogeyPojo) {
       // handle the message
    }

    @StreamListener(target = Sink.INPUT, condition = "headers['type']=='bacall'")
    public void receiveBacall(@Payload BacallPojo bacallPojo) {
       // handle the message
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Content Type Negotiation in the Context of <literal>condition</literal></emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>It is important to understand some of the mechanics behind content-based routing using the <literal>condition</literal> argument of <literal>@StreamListener</literal>, especially in the context of the type of the message as a whole.
It may also help if you familiarize yourself with the <xref linkend="content-type-management"/>  before you proceed.</simpara>
<simpara>Consider the following scenario:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class CatsAndDogs {

    @StreamListener(target = Sink.INPUT, condition = "payload.class.simpleName=='Dog'")
    public void bark(Dog dog) {
       // handle the message
    }

    @StreamListener(target = Sink.INPUT, condition = "payload.class.simpleName=='Cat'")
    public void purr(Cat cat) {
       // handle the message
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The preceding code is perfectly valid. It compiles and deploys without any issues, yet it never produces the result you expect.</simpara>
<simpara>That is because you are testing something that does not yet exist in a state you expect. That is because the payload of the message is not yet converted from the
wire format (<literal>byte[]</literal>) to the desired type.
In other words, it has not yet gone through the type conversion process described in the <xref linkend="content-type-management"/>.</simpara>
<simpara>So, unless you use a SPeL expression that evaluates raw data (for example, the value of the first byte in the byte array), use message header-based expressions
(such as <literal>condition = "headers['type']=='dog'"</literal>).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>At the moment, dispatching through <literal>@StreamListener</literal> conditions is supported only for channel-based binders (not for reactive programming)
support.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_spring_cloud_function">
<title>Spring Cloud Function support</title>
<simpara>Since Spring Cloud Stream v2.1, another alternative for defining <emphasis>stream handlers</emphasis> and <emphasis>sources</emphasis> is to use build-in
support for <link xl:href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-function/">Spring Cloud Function</link> where they can be expressed as beans of
 type <literal>java.util.function.[Supplier/Function/Consumer]</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To specify which functional bean to bind to the external destination(s) exposed by the bindings, you must provide <literal>spring.cloud.stream.function.definition</literal> property.</simpara>
<simpara>Here is the example of the Processor application exposing message handler as <literal>java.util.function.Function</literal></simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication

<simpara>In the above you we simply define a bean of type <literal>java.util.function.Function</literal> called <emphasis>toUpperCase</emphasis> and identify it as a bean to be used as message handler
whose 'input' and 'output' must be bound to the external destinations exposed by the Processor binding.</simpara>
<simpara>Below are the examples of simple functional applications to support Source, Processor and Sink.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_functional_composition">
<title>Functional Composition</title>
<simpara>Using this programming model you can also benefit from functional composition where you can dynamically compose complex handlers from a set of simple functions.

<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public Function&lt;String, String&gt; wrapInQuotes() {

<simpara>and modify the <literal>spring.cloud.stream.function.definition</literal> property to reflect your intention to compose a new function from both ‘toUpperCase’ and ‘wrapInQuotes’.
To do that Spring Cloud Function allows you to use <literal>|</literal> (pipe) symbol. So to finish our example our property will now look like this:</simpara>

<title>Using Polled Consumers</title>
<section xml:id="_overview">
<title>Overview</title>
<simpara>When using polled consumers, you poll the <literal>PollableMessageSource</literal> on demand.
Consider the following example of a polled consumer:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface PolledConsumer {

    @Input
    PollableMessageSource destIn();

    @Output
    MessageChannel destOut();

}</programlisting>
<simpara>Given the polled consumer in the preceding example, you might use it as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public ApplicationRunner poller(PollableMessageSource destIn, MessageChannel destOut) {
    return args -&gt; {
        while (someCondition()) {
            try {
                if (!destIn.poll(m -&gt; {
                    String newPayload = ((String) m.getPayload()).toUpperCase();
                    destOut.send(new GenericMessage&lt;&gt;(newPayload));
                })) {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                }
            }
            catch (Exception e) {
                // handle failure
            }
        }
    };
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>PollableMessageSource.poll()</literal> method takes a <literal>MessageHandler</literal> argument (often a lambda expression, as shown here).
It returns <literal>true</literal> if the message was received and successfully processed.</simpara>
<simpara>As with message-driven consumers, if the <literal>MessageHandler</literal> throws an exception, messages are published to error channels, as discussed in <quote><xref linkend="binder-error-channels"/></quote>.</simpara>
<simpara>Normally, the <literal>poll()</literal> method acknowledges the message when the <literal>MessageHandler</literal> exits.
If the method exits abnormally, the message is rejected (not re-queued), but see <xref linkend="polled-errors"/>.
You can override that behavior by taking responsibility for the acknowledgment, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public ApplicationRunner poller(PollableMessageSource dest1In, MessageChannel dest2Out) {
    return args -&gt; {
        while (someCondition()) {
            if (!dest1In.poll(m -&gt; {
                StaticMessageHeaderAccessor.getAcknowledgmentCallback(m).noAutoAck();
                // e.g. hand off to another thread which can perform the ack
                // or acknowledge(Status.REQUEUE)

            })) {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            }
        }
    };
}</programlisting>
<important>
<simpara>You must <literal>ack</literal> (or <literal>nack</literal>) the message at some point, to avoid resource leaks.</simpara>
</important>
<important>
<simpara>Some messaging systems (such as Apache Kafka) maintain a simple offset in a log. If a delivery fails and is re-queued with  <literal>StaticMessageHeaderAccessor.getAcknowledgmentCallback(m).acknowledge(Status.REQUEUE);</literal>, any later successfully ack&#8217;d messages are redelivered.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>There is also an overloaded <literal>poll</literal> method, for which the definition is as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">poll(MessageHandler handler, ParameterizedTypeReference&lt;?&gt; type)</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>type</literal> is a conversion hint that allows the incoming message payload to be converted, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">boolean result = pollableSource.poll(received -&gt; {
			Map&lt;String, Foo&gt; payload = (Map&lt;String, Foo&gt;) received.getPayload();
            ...

		}, new ParameterizedTypeReference&lt;Map&lt;String, Foo&gt;&gt;() {});</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="polled-errors">
<title>Handling Errors</title>
<simpara>By default, an error channel is configured for the pollable source; if the callback throws an exception, an <literal>ErrorMessage</literal> is sent to the error channel (<literal>&lt;destination&gt;.&lt;group&gt;.errors</literal>); this error channel is also bridged to the global Spring Integration <literal>errorChannel</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>You can subscribe to either error channel with a <literal>@ServiceActivator</literal> to handle errors; without a subscription, the error will simply be logged and the message will be acknowledged as successful.
If the error channel service activator throws an exception, the message will be rejected (by default) and won&#8217;t be redelivered.
If the service activator throws a <literal>RequeueCurrentMessageException</literal>, the message will be requeued at the broker and will be again retrieved on a subsequent poll.</simpara>
<simpara>If the listener throws a <literal>RequeueCurrentMessageException</literal> directly, the message will be requeued, as discussed above, and will not be sent to the error channels.</simpara>

<section xml:id="spring-cloud-stream-overview-error-handling">
<title>Error Handling</title>
<simpara>Errors happen, and Spring Cloud Stream provides several flexible mechanisms to handle them.
The error handling comes in two flavors:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">application:</emphasis> The error handling is done within the application (custom error handler).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">system:</emphasis> The error handling is delegated to the binder (re-queue, DL, and others). Note that the techniques are dependent on binder implementation and the
capability of the underlying messaging middleware.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream uses the <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry">Spring Retry</link> library to facilitate successful message processing. See <xref linkend="_retry_template"/> for more details.
However, when all fails, the exceptions thrown by the message handlers are propagated back to the binder. At that point, binder invokes custom error handler or communicates
the error back to the messaging system (re-queue, DLQ, and others).</simpara>
<section xml:id="_application_error_handling">
<title>Application Error Handling</title>
<simpara>There are two types of application-level error handling. Errors can be handled at each binding subscription or a global handler can handle all the binding subscription errors. Let&#8217;s review the details.</simpara>
<figure>
<title>A Spring Cloud Stream Sink Application with Custom and Global Error Handlers</title>

<imagedata fileref="images/custom_vs_global_error_channels.png" width="75%" align="center"/>
</imageobject>
<textobject><phrase>custom vs global error channels</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>For each input binding, Spring Cloud Stream creates a dedicated error channel with the following semantics <literal>&lt;destinationName&gt;.errors</literal>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The <literal>&lt;destinationName&gt;</literal> consists of the name of the binding (such as <literal>input</literal>) and the name of the group (such as <literal>myGroup</literal>).</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Consider the following:</simpara>
<programlisting language="text" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.group=myGroup</programlisting>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@StreamListener(Sink.INPUT) // destination name 'input.myGroup'
public void handle(Person value) {
	throw new RuntimeException("BOOM!");
}

@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = Processor.INPUT + ".myGroup.errors") //channel name 'input.myGroup.errors'
public void error(Message&lt;?&gt; message) {
	System.out.println("Handling ERROR: " + message);
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In the preceding example the destination name is <literal>input.myGroup</literal> and the dedicated error channel name is <literal>input.myGroup.errors</literal>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The use of @StreamListener annotation is intended specifically to define bindings that bridge internal channels and external destinations. Given that the destination
specific error channel does NOT have an associated external destination, such channel is a prerogative of Spring Integration (SI). This means that the handler
for such destination must be defined using one of the SI handler annotations (i.e., @ServiceActivator, @Transformer etc.).</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>If <literal>group</literal> is not specified anonymous group is used (something like <literal>input.anonymous.2K37rb06Q6m2r51-SPIDDQ</literal>), which is not suitable for error
handling scenarious, since you don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s going to be until the destination is created.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Also, in the event you are binding to the existing destination such as:</simpara>
<programlisting language="text" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=myFooDestination
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.group=myGroup</programlisting>
<simpara>the full destination name is <literal>myFooDestination.myGroup</literal> and then the dedicated error channel name is <literal>myFooDestination.myGroup.errors</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Back to the example&#8230;&#8203;</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>handle(..)</literal> method, which subscribes to the channel named <literal>input</literal>, throws an exception.  Given there is also a subscriber to the error channel <literal>input.myGroup.errors</literal>
all error messages are handled by this subscriber.</simpara>
<simpara>If you have multiple bindings, you may want to have a single error handler. Spring Cloud Stream automatically provides support for
a <emphasis>global error channel</emphasis> by bridging each individual error channel to the channel named <literal>errorChannel</literal>, allowing a single subscriber to handle all errors,
as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@StreamListener("errorChannel")
public void error(Message&lt;?&gt; message) {
	System.out.println("Handling ERROR: " + message);
}</programlisting>
<simpara>This may be a convenient option if error handling logic is the same regardless of which handler produced the error.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_system_error_handling">
<title>System Error Handling</title>
<simpara>System-level error handling implies that the errors are communicated back to the messaging system and, given that not every messaging system
is the same, the capabilities may differ from binder to binder.</simpara>
<simpara>That said, in this section we explain the general idea behind system level error handling and use Rabbit binder as an example. NOTE: Kafka binder provides similar
support, although some configuration properties do differ. Also, for more details and configuration options, see the individual binder&#8217;s documentation.</simpara>
<simpara>If no internal error handlers are configured, the errors propagate to the binders, and the binders subsequently propagate those errors back to the messaging system.
Depending on the capabilities of the messaging system such a system may <emphasis>drop</emphasis> the message, <emphasis>re-queue</emphasis> the message for re-processing or <emphasis>send the failed message to DLQ</emphasis>.
Both Rabbit and Kafka support these concepts. However, other binders may not, so refer to your individual binder’s documentation for details on supported system-level
error-handling options.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_drop_failed_messages">
<title>Drop Failed Messages</title>
<simpara>By default, if no additional system-level configuration is provided, the messaging system drops the failed message.
While acceptable in some cases, for most cases, it is not, and we need some recovery mechanism to avoid message loss.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_dlq_dead_letter_queue">
<title>DLQ - Dead Letter Queue</title>
<simpara>DLQ allows failed messages to be sent to a special destination: - <emphasis>Dead Letter Queue</emphasis>.</simpara>
<simpara>When configured, failed messages are sent to this destination for subsequent re-processing or auditing and reconciliation.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, continuing on the previous example and to set up the DLQ with Rabbit binder, you need to set the following property:</simpara>
<programlisting language="text" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.bindings.input.consumer.auto-bind-dlq=true</programlisting>
<simpara>Keep in mind that, in the above property, <literal>input</literal> corresponds to the name of the input destination binding.
The <literal>consumer</literal> indicates that it is a consumer property and <literal>auto-bind-dlq</literal> instructs the binder to configure DLQ for <literal>input</literal>
destination, which results in an additional Rabbit queue named <literal>input.myGroup.dlq</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Once configured, all failed messages are routed to this queue with an error message similar to the following:</simpara>
<programlisting language="text" linenumbering="unnumbered">delivery_mode:	1
headers:
x-death:
count:	1
reason:	rejected
queue:	input.hello
time:	1522328151
exchange:
routing-keys:	input.myGroup
Payload {"name”:"Bob"}</programlisting>
<simpara>As you can see from the above, your original message is preserved for further actions.</simpara>
<simpara>However, one thing you may have noticed is that there is limited information on the original issue with the message processing. For example, you do not see a stack
trace corresponding to the original error.
To get more relevant information about the original error, you must set an additional property:</simpara>
<programlisting language="text" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.bindings.input.consumer.republish-to-dlq=true</programlisting>
<simpara>Doing so forces the internal error handler to intercept the error message and add additional information to it before publishing it to DLQ.
Once configured, you can see that the error message contains more information relevant to the original error, as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="text" linenumbering="unnumbered">delivery_mode:	2
headers:
x-original-exchange:
x-exception-message:	has an error
x-original-routingKey:	input.myGroup
x-exception-stacktrace:	org.springframework.messaging.MessageHandlingException: nested exception is
      org.springframework.messaging.MessagingException: has an error, failedMessage=GenericMessage [payload=byte[15],
      headers={amqp_receivedDeliveryMode=NON_PERSISTENT, amqp_receivedRoutingKey=input.hello, amqp_deliveryTag=1,
      deliveryAttempt=3, amqp_consumerQueue=input.hello, amqp_redelivered=false, id=a15231e6-3f80-677b-5ad7-d4b1e61e486e,
      amqp_consumerTag=amq.ctag-skBFapilvtZhDsn0k3ZmQg, contentType=application/json, timestamp=1522327846136}]
      at org.spring...integ...han...MethodInvokingMessageProcessor.processMessage(MethodInvokingMessageProcessor.java:107)
      at. . . . .
Payload {"name”:"Bob"}</programlisting>
<simpara>This effectively combines application-level and system-level error handling to further assist with downstream troubleshooting mechanics.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_re_queue_failed_messages">
<title>Re-queue Failed Messages</title>
<simpara>As mentioned earlier, the currently supported binders (Rabbit and Kafka) rely on <literal>RetryTemplate</literal> to facilitate successful message processing. See <xref linkend="_retry_template"/> for details.
However, for cases when <literal>max-attempts</literal> property is set to 1, internal reprocessing of the message is disabled. At this point, you can facilitate message re-processing (re-tries)
by instructing the messaging system to re-queue the failed message. Once re-queued, the failed message is sent back to the original handler, essentially creating a retry loop.</simpara>
<simpara>This option may be feasible for cases where the nature of the error is related to some sporadic yet short-term unavailability of some resource.</simpara>
<simpara>To accomplish that, you must set the following properties:</simpara>
<programlisting language="text" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.consumer.max-attempts=1
spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.bindings.input.consumer.requeue-rejected=true</programlisting>
<simpara>In the preceding example, the <literal>max-attempts</literal> set to 1 essentially disabling internal re-tries and <literal>requeue-rejected</literal> (short for <emphasis>requeue rejected messages</emphasis>) is set to <literal>true</literal>.
Once set, the failed message is resubmitted to the same handler and loops continuously or until the handler throws <literal>AmqpRejectAndDontRequeueException</literal>
essentially allowing you to build your own re-try logic within the handler itself.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="_retry_template">
<title>Retry Template</title>
<simpara>The <literal>RetryTemplate</literal> is part of the <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry">Spring Retry</link> library.
While it is out of scope of this document to cover all of the capabilities of the <literal>RetryTemplate</literal>, we will mention the following consumer properties that are specifically related to
the <literal>RetryTemplate</literal>:</simpara>
<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term>retryableExceptions</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>A map of Throwable class names in the key and a boolean in the value.
Specify those exceptions (and subclasses) that will or won&#8217;t be retried.
Also see <literal>defaultRetriable</literal>.
Example: <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.consumer.retryable-exceptions.java.lang.IllegalStateException=false</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Default: empty.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<simpara>While the preceding settings are sufficient for majority of the customization requirements, they may not satisfy certain complex requirements at, which
point you may want to provide your own instance of the <literal>RetryTemplate</literal>. To do so configure it as a bean in your application configuration. The application provided
instance will override the one provided by the framework. Also, to avoid conflicts you must qualify the instance of the <literal>RetryTemplate</literal> you want to be used by the binder
as <literal>@StreamRetryTemplate</literal>. For example,</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@StreamRetryTemplate
public RetryTemplate myRetryTemplate() {
    return new RetryTemplate();
}</programlisting>
<simpara>As you can see from the above example you don&#8217;t need to annotate it with <literal>@Bean</literal> since <literal>@StreamRetryTemplate</literal> is a qualified <literal>@Bean</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="spring-cloud-stream-overview-reactive-programming-support">
<title>Reactive Programming Support</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream also supports the use of reactive APIs where incoming and outgoing data is handled as continuous data flows.
Support for reactive APIs is available through <literal>spring-cloud-stream-reactive</literal>, which needs to be added explicitly to your project.</simpara>
<simpara>The programming model with reactive APIs is declarative. Instead of specifying how each individual message should be handled, you can use operators that describe functional transformations from inbound to outbound data flows.</simpara>
<simpara>At present Spring Cloud Stream supports the only the <link xl:href="https://projectreactor.io/">Reactor API</link>.
In the future, we intend to support a more generic model based on Reactive Streams.</simpara>
<simpara>The reactive programming model also uses the <literal>@StreamListener</literal> annotation for setting up reactive handlers.
The differences are that:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>The <literal>@StreamListener</literal> annotation must not specify an input or output, as they are provided as arguments and return values from the method.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The arguments of the method must be annotated with <literal>@Input</literal> and <literal>@Output</literal>, indicating which input or output the incoming and outgoing data flows connect to, respectively.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The return value of the method, if any, is annotated with <literal>@Output</literal>, indicating the input where data should be sent.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<note>
<simpara>Reactive programming support requires Java 1.8.</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>As of Spring Cloud Stream 1.1.1 and later (starting with release train Brooklyn.SR2), reactive programming support requires the use of Reactor 3.0.4.RELEASE and higher.
Earlier Reactor versions (including 3.0.1.RELEASE, 3.0.2.RELEASE and 3.0.3.RELEASE) are not supported.
<literal>spring-cloud-stream-reactive</literal> transitively retrieves the proper version, but it is possible for the project structure to manage the version of the <literal>io.projectreactor:reactor-core</literal> to an earlier release, especially when using Maven.
This is the case for projects generated by using Spring Initializr with Spring Boot 1.x, which overrides the Reactor version to <literal>2.0.8.RELEASE</literal>.
In such cases, you must ensure that the proper version of the artifact is released.
You can do so by adding a direct dependency on <literal>io.projectreactor:reactor-core</literal> with a version of <literal>3.0.4.RELEASE</literal> or later to your project.</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>The use of term, <quote>reactive</quote>, currently refers to the reactive APIs being used and not to the execution model being reactive (that is, the bound endpoints still use a 'push' rather than a 'pull' model). While some backpressure support is provided by the use of Reactor, we do intend, in a future release, to support entirely reactive pipelines by the use of native reactive clients for the connected middleware.</simpara>
</note>
<section xml:id="_reactor_based_handlers">
<title>Reactor-based Handlers</title>
<simpara>A Reactor-based handler can have the following argument types:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>For arguments annotated with <literal>@Input</literal>, it supports the  Reactor <literal>Flux</literal> type.
The parameterization of the inbound Flux follows the same rules as in the case of individual message handling: It can be the entire <literal>Message</literal>, a POJO that can be the <literal>Message</literal> payload, or a POJO that is the result of a transformation based on the <literal>Message</literal> content-type header. Multiple inputs are provided.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>For arguments annotated with <literal>Output</literal>, it supports the <literal>FluxSender</literal> type, which connects a <literal>Flux</literal> produced by the method with an output. Generally speaking, specifying outputs as arguments is only recommended when the method can have multiple outputs.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>A Reactor-based handler supports a return type of <literal>Flux</literal>. In that case, it must be annotated with <literal>@Output</literal>. We recommend using the return value of the method when a single output <literal>Flux</literal> is available.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows a Reactor-based <literal>Processor</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class UppercaseTransformer {

  @StreamListener
  @Output(Processor.OUTPUT)
  public Flux&lt;String&gt; receive(@Input(Processor.INPUT) Flux&lt;String&gt; input) {
    return input.map(s -&gt; s.toUpperCase());
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The same processor using output arguments looks like the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class UppercaseTransformer {

  @StreamListener
  public void receive(@Input(Processor.INPUT) Flux&lt;String&gt; input,
     @Output(Processor.OUTPUT) FluxSender output) {
     output.send(input.map(s -&gt; s.toUpperCase()));
  }
}</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_reactive_sources">
<title>Reactive Sources</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream reactive support also provides the ability for creating reactive sources through the <literal>@StreamEmitter</literal> annotation.
By using the <literal>@StreamEmitter</literal> annotation, a regular source may be converted to a reactive one.
<literal>@StreamEmitter</literal> is a method level annotation that marks a method to be an emitter to outputs declared with <literal>@EnableBinding</literal>.
You cannot use the <literal>@Input</literal> annotation along with <literal>@StreamEmitter</literal>, as the methods marked with this annotation are not listening for any input. Rather, methods marked with <literal>@StreamEmitter</literal> generate output.
Following the same programming model used in <literal>@StreamListener</literal>, <literal>@StreamEmitter</literal> also allows flexible ways of using the <literal>@Output</literal> annotation, depending on whether the method has any arguments, a return type, and other considerations.</simpara>
<simpara>The remainder of this section contains examples of using the <literal>@StreamEmitter</literal> annotation in various styles.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example emits the <literal>Hello, World</literal> message every millisecond and publishes to a Reactor <literal>Flux</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Source.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class HelloWorldEmitter {

  @StreamEmitter
  @Output(Source.OUTPUT)
  public Flux&lt;String&gt; emit() {
    return Flux.intervalMillis(1)
            .map(l -&gt; "Hello World");
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In the preceding example, the resulting messages in the <literal>Flux</literal> are sent to the output channel of the <literal>Source</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>The next example is another flavor of an <literal>@StreamEmmitter</literal> that sends a Reactor <literal>Flux</literal>.
Instead of returning a <literal>Flux</literal>, the following method uses a <literal>FluxSender</literal> to programmatically send a <literal>Flux</literal> from a source:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Source.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class HelloWorldEmitter {

  @StreamEmitter
  @Output(Source.OUTPUT)
  public void emit(FluxSender output) {
    output.send(Flux.intervalMillis(1)
            .map(l -&gt; "Hello World"));
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The next example is exactly same as the above snippet in functionality and style.
However, instead of using an explicit <literal>@Output</literal> annotation on the method, it uses the annotation on the method parameter.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Source.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class HelloWorldEmitter {

  @StreamEmitter
  public void emit(@Output(Source.OUTPUT) FluxSender output) {
    output.send(Flux.intervalMillis(1)
            .map(l -&gt; "Hello World"));
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The last example in this section is yet another flavor of writing reacting sources by using the Reactive Streams Publisher API and taking advantage of the support for it in <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration-java-dsl/wiki/Spring-Integration-Java-DSL-Reference">Spring Integration Java DSL</link>.
The <literal>Publisher</literal> in the following example still uses Reactor <literal>Flux</literal> under the hood, but, from an application perspective, that is transparent to the user and only needs Reactive Streams and Java DSL for Spring Integration:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Source.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class HelloWorldEmitter {

  @StreamEmitter
  @Output(Source.OUTPUT)
  @Bean

<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides a Binder abstraction for use in connecting to physical destinations at the external middleware.
This section provides information about the main concepts behind the Binder SPI, its main components, and implementation-specific details.</simpara>

<title>Producers and Consumers</title>
<simpara>The following image shows the general relationship of producers and consumers:</simpara>

<simpara>A producer is any component that sends messages to a channel.
The channel can be bound to an external message broker with a <literal>Binder</literal> implementation for that broker.
When invoking the <literal>bindProducer()</literal> method, the first parameter is the name of the destination within the broker, the second parameter is the local channel instance to which the producer sends messages, and the third parameter contains properties (such as a partition key expression) to be used within the adapter that is created for that channel.</simpara>
<simpara>A consumer is any component that receives messages from a channel.
As with a producer, the consumer&#8217;s channel can be bound to an external message broker.
When invoking the <literal>bindConsumer()</literal> method, the first parameter is the destination name, and a second parameter provides the name of a logical group of consumers.
Each group that is represented by consumer bindings for a given destination receives a copy of each message that a producer sends to that destination (that is, it follows normal publish-subscribe semantics).
If there are multiple consumer instances bound with the same group name, then messages are load-balanced across those consumer instances so that each message sent by a producer is consumed by only a single consumer instance within each group (that is, it follows normal queueing semantics).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="spring-cloud-stream-overview-binder-api">
<title>Binder SPI</title>
<simpara>The Binder SPI consists of a number of interfaces, out-of-the box utility classes, and discovery strategies that provide a pluggable mechanism for connecting to external middleware.</simpara>
<simpara>The key point of the SPI is the <literal>Binder</literal> interface, which is a strategy for connecting inputs and outputs to external middleware. The following listing shows the definnition of the <literal>Binder</literal> interface:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface Binder&lt;T, C extends ConsumerProperties, P extends ProducerProperties&gt; {
    Binding&lt;T&gt; bindConsumer(String name, String group, T inboundBindTarget, C consumerProperties);

    Binding&lt;T&gt; bindProducer(String name, T outboundBindTarget, P producerProperties);
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The interface is parameterized, offering a number of extension points:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Input and output bind targets. As of version 1.0, only <literal>MessageChannel</literal> is supported, but this is intended to be used as an extension point in the future.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Extended consumer and producer properties, allowing specific Binder implementations to add supplemental properties that can be supported in a type-safe manner.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>A typical binder implementation consists of the following:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>A class that implements the <literal>Binder</literal> interface;</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>A Spring <literal>@Configuration</literal> class that creates a bean of type <literal>Binder</literal> along with the middleware connection infrastructure.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>A <literal>META-INF/spring.binders</literal> file found on the classpath containing one or more binder definitions, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>kafka:\
org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.kafka.config.KafkaBinderConfiguration</screen>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>
<section xml:id="_binder_detection">
<title>Binder Detection</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream relies on implementations of the Binder SPI to perform the task of connecting channels to message brokers.
Each Binder implementation typically connects to one type of messaging system.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_classpath_detection">
<title>Classpath Detection</title>
<simpara>By default, Spring Cloud Stream relies on Spring Boot&#8217;s auto-configuration to configure the binding process.
If a single Binder implementation is found on the classpath, Spring Cloud Stream automatically uses it.
For example, a Spring Cloud Stream project that aims to bind only to RabbitMQ can add the following dependency:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>For the specific Maven coordinates of other binder dependencies, see the documentation of that binder implementation.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="multiple-binders">
<title>Multiple Binders on the Classpath</title>
<simpara>When multiple binders are present on the classpath, the application must indicate which binder is to be used for each channel binding.
Each binder configuration contains a <literal>META-INF/spring.binders</literal> file, which is a simple properties file, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>rabbit:\
org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.rabbit.config.RabbitServiceAutoConfiguration</screen>
<simpara>Similar files exist for the other provided binder implementations (such as Kafka), and custom binder implementations are expected to provide them as well.
The key represents an identifying name for the binder implementation, whereas the value is a comma-separated list of configuration classes that each contain one and only one bean definition of type <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.Binder</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Binder selection can either be performed globally, using the <literal>spring.cloud.stream.defaultBinder</literal> property (for example, <literal>spring.cloud.stream.defaultBinder=rabbit</literal>) or individually, by configuring the binder on each channel binding.
For instance, a processor application (that has channels named <literal>input</literal> and <literal>output</literal> for read and write respectively) that reads from Kafka and writes to RabbitMQ can specify the following configuration:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.binder=kafka
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.binder=rabbit</screen>
</section>
<section xml:id="multiple-systems">
<title>Connecting to Multiple Systems</title>
<simpara>By default, binders share the application&#8217;s Spring Boot auto-configuration, so that one instance of each binder found on the classpath is created.
If your application should connect to more than one broker of the same type, you can specify multiple binder configurations, each with different environment settings.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Turning on explicit binder configuration disables the default binder configuration process altogether.
If you do so, all binders in use must be included in the configuration.
Frameworks that intend to use Spring Cloud Stream transparently may create binder configurations that can be referenced by name, but they do not affect the default binder configuration.
In order to do so, a binder configuration may have its <literal>defaultCandidate</literal> flag set to false (for example, <literal>spring.cloud.stream.binders.&lt;configurationName&gt;.defaultCandidate=false</literal>).
This denotes a configuration that exists independently of the default binder configuration process.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>The following example shows a typical configuration for a processor application that connects to two RabbitMQ broker instances:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    stream:
      bindings:
        input:
          destination: thing1
          binder: rabbit1
        output:
          destination: thing2
          binder: rabbit2
      binders:
        rabbit1:
          type: rabbit
          environment:
            spring:
              rabbitmq:
                host: &lt;host1&gt;
        rabbit2:
          type: rabbit

            spring:

<section xml:id="_binding_visualization_and_control">
<title>Binding visualization and control</title>
<simpara>Since version 2.0, Spring Cloud Stream supports visualization and control of the Bindings through Actuator endpoints.</simpara>
<simpara>Starting with version 2.0 actuator and web are optional, you must first add one of the web dependencies as well as add the actuator dependency manually.
The following example shows how to add the dependency for the Web framework:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
     &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
     &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-web&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>The following example shows how to add the dependency for the WebFlux framework:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
       &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
       &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-webflux&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>You can add the Actuator dependency as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-actuator&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>To run Spring Cloud Stream 2.0 apps in Cloud Foundry, you must add <literal>spring-boot-starter-web</literal> and <literal>spring-boot-starter-actuator</literal> to the classpath. Otherwise, the
application will not start due to health check failures.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>You must also enable the <literal>bindings</literal> actuator endpoints by setting the following property: <literal>--management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=bindings</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Once those prerequisites are satisfied. you should see the following in the logs when application start:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">: Mapped "{[/actuator/bindings/{name}],methods=[POST]. . .
: Mapped "{[/actuator/bindings],methods=[GET]. . .
: Mapped "{[/actuator/bindings/{name}],methods=[GET]. . .</literallayout>
<simpara>To visualize the current bindings, access the following URL:
<literal><link xl:href="http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/actuator/bindings">http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/actuator/bindings</link></literal></simpara>
<simpara>Alternative, to see a single binding, access one of the URLs similar to the following:
<literal><link xl:href="http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/actuator/bindings/myBindingName">http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/actuator/bindings/myBindingName</link></literal></simpara>
<simpara>You can also stop, start, pause, and resume individual bindings by posting to the same URL while providing a <literal>state</literal> argument as JSON, as shown in the following examples:</simpara>
<simpara>curl -d '{"state":"STOPPED"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST <link xl:href="http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/actuator/bindings/myBindingName">http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/actuator/bindings/myBindingName</link>
curl -d '{"state":"STARTED"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST <link xl:href="http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/actuator/bindings/myBindingName">http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/actuator/bindings/myBindingName</link>
curl -d '{"state":"PAUSED"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST <link xl:href="http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/actuator/bindings/myBindingName">http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/actuator/bindings/myBindingName</link>
curl -d '{"state":"RESUMED"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST <link xl:href="http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/actuator/bindings/myBindingName">http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/actuator/bindings/myBindingName</link></simpara>
<note>
<simpara><literal>PAUSED</literal> and <literal>RESUMED</literal> work only when the corresponding binder and its underlying technology supports it. Otherwise, you see the warning message in the logs.
Currently, only Kafka binder supports the <literal>PAUSED</literal> and <literal>RESUMED</literal> states.</simpara>

<title>Using Dynamically Bound Destinations</title>
<simpara>Besides the channels defined by using <literal>@EnableBinding</literal>, Spring Cloud Stream lets applications send messages to dynamically bound destinations.
This is useful, for example, when the target destination needs to be determined at runtime.
Applications can do so by using the <literal>BinderAwareChannelResolver</literal> bean, registered automatically by the <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> annotation.</simpara>
<simpara>The 'spring.cloud.stream.dynamicDestinations' property can be used for restricting the dynamic destination names to a known set (whitelisting).
If this property is not set, any destination can be bound dynamically.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>BinderAwareChannelResolver</literal> can be used directly, as shown in the following example of a REST controller using a path variable to decide the target channel:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding
@Controller
public class SourceWithDynamicDestination {

    @Autowired
    private BinderAwareChannelResolver resolver;

    @RequestMapping(path = "/{target}", method = POST, consumes = "*/*")
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.ACCEPTED)
    public void handleRequest(@RequestBody String body, @PathVariable("target") target,
           @RequestHeader(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE) Object contentType) {
        sendMessage(body, target, contentType);
    }

    private void sendMessage(String body, String target, Object contentType) {
        resolver.resolveDestination(target).send(MessageBuilder.createMessage(body,
                new MessageHeaders(Collections.singletonMap(MessageHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE, contentType))));
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Now consider what happens when we start the application on the default port (8080) and make the following requests with CURL:</simpara>
<screen>curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d "customer-1" http://localhost:8080/customers

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d "order-1" http://localhost:8080/orders</screen>
<simpara>The destinations, 'customers' and 'orders', are created in the broker (in the exchange for Rabbit or in the topic for Kafka) with names of 'customers' and 'orders', and the data is published to the appropriate destinations.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>BinderAwareChannelResolver</literal> is a general-purpose Spring Integration <literal>DestinationResolver</literal> and can be injected in other components&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for example, in a router using a SpEL expression based on the <literal>target</literal> field of an incoming JSON message. The following example includes a router that reads SpEL expressions:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding
@Controller
public class SourceWithDynamicDestination {

    @Autowired
    private BinderAwareChannelResolver resolver;


    @RequestMapping(path = "/", method = POST, consumes = "application/json")
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.ACCEPTED)
    public void handleRequest(@RequestBody String body, @RequestHeader(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE) Object contentType) {
        sendMessage(body, contentType);
    }

    private void sendMessage(Object body, Object contentType) {
        routerChannel().send(MessageBuilder.createMessage(body,
                new MessageHeaders(Collections.singletonMap(MessageHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE, contentType))));
    }

    @Bean(name = "routerChannel")
    public MessageChannel routerChannel() {
        return new DirectChannel();
    }

    @Bean
    @ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "routerChannel")
    public ExpressionEvaluatingRouter router() {
        ExpressionEvaluatingRouter router =
            new ExpressionEvaluatingRouter(new SpelExpressionParser().parseExpression("payload.target"));
        router.setDefaultOutputChannelName("default-output");
        router.setChannelResolver(resolver);
        return router;
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/router">Router Sink Application</link> uses this technique to create the destinations on-demand.</simpara>
<simpara>If the channel names are known in advance, you can configure the producer properties as with any other destination.
Alternatively, if you register a <literal>NewBindingCallback&lt;&gt;</literal> bean, it is invoked just before the binding is created.
The callback takes the generic type of the extended producer properties used by the binder.
It has one method:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">void configure(String channelName, MessageChannel channel, ProducerProperties producerProperties,
        T extendedProducerProperties);</programlisting>
<simpara>The following example shows how to use the RabbitMQ binder:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public NewBindingCallback&lt;RabbitProducerProperties&gt; dynamicConfigurer() {
    return (name, channel, props, extended) -&gt; {
        props.setRequiredGroups("bindThisQueue");
        extended.setQueueNameGroupOnly(true);
        extended.setAutoBindDlq(true);
        extended.setDeadLetterQueueName("myDLQ");
    };
}</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>If you need to support dynamic destinations with multiple binder types, use <literal>Object</literal> for the generic type and cast the <literal>extended</literal> argument as needed.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="content-type-management">
<title>Content Type Negotiation</title>
<simpara>Data transformation is one of the core features of any message-driven microservice architecture. Given that, in Spring Cloud Stream, such data
is represented as a Spring <literal>Message</literal>, a message may have to be transformed to a desired shape or size before reaching its destination. This is required for two reasons:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>To convert the contents of the incoming message to match the signature of the application-provided handler.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>To convert the contents of the outgoing message to the wire format.</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>The wire format is typically <literal>byte[]</literal> (that is true for the Kafka and Rabbit binders), but it is governed by the binder implementation.</simpara>
<simpara>In Spring Cloud Stream, message transformation is accomplished with an <literal>org.springframework.messaging.converter.MessageConverter</literal>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>As a supplement to the details to follow, you may also want to read the following <link xl:href="https://spring.io/blog/2018/02/26/spring-cloud-stream-2-0-content-type-negotiation-and-transformation">blog post</link>.</simpara>
</note>
<section xml:id="_mechanics">
<title>Mechanics</title>
<simpara>To better understand the mechanics and the necessity behind content-type negotiation, we take a look at a very simple use case by using the following message handler as an example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@StreamListener(Processor.INPUT)
@SendTo(Processor.OUTPUT)
public String handle(Person person) {..}</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>For simplicity, we assume that this is the only handler in the application (we assume there is no internal pipeline).</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>The handler shown in the preceding example expects a <literal>Person</literal> object as an argument and produces a <literal>String</literal> type as an output.
In order for the framework to succeed in passing the incoming <literal>Message</literal> as an argument to this handler, it has to somehow transform the payload of the <literal>Message</literal> type from the wire format to a <literal>Person</literal> type.
In other words, the framework must locate and apply the appropriate <literal>MessageConverter</literal>.
To accomplish that, the framework needs some instructions from the user.
One of these instructions is already provided by the signature of the handler method itself (<literal>Person</literal> type).
Consequently, in theory, that should be (and, in some cases, is) enough.
However, for the majority of use cases, in order to select the appropriate <literal>MessageConverter</literal>, the framework needs an additional piece of information.
That missing piece is <literal>contentType</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides three mechanisms to define <literal>contentType</literal> (in order of precedence):</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">HEADER</emphasis>: The <literal>contentType</literal> can be communicated through the Message itself. By providing a <literal>contentType</literal> header, you declare the content type to use to locate and apply the appropriate <literal>MessageConverter</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">BINDING</emphasis>: The <literal>contentType</literal> can be set per destination binding by setting the <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.content-type</literal> property.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The <literal>input</literal> segment in the property name corresponds to the actual name of the destination (which is “input” in our case). This approach lets you declare, on a per-binding basis, the content type to use to locate and apply the appropriate <literal>MessageConverter</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">DEFAULT</emphasis>: If <literal>contentType</literal> is not present in the <literal>Message</literal> header or the binding, the default <literal>application/json</literal> content type is used to
locate and apply the appropriate <literal>MessageConverter</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>As mentioned earlier, the preceding list also demonstrates the order of precedence in case of a tie. For example, a header-provided content type takes precedence over any other content type.
The same applies for a content type set on a per-binding basis, which essentially lets you override the default content type.
However, it also provides a sensible default (which was determined from community feedback).</simpara>
<simpara>Another reason for making <literal>application/json</literal> the default stems from the interoperability requirements driven by distributed microservices architectures, where producer and consumer not only run in different JVMs but can also run on different non-JVM platforms.</simpara>
<simpara>When the non-void handler method returns, if the the return value is already a <literal>Message</literal>, that <literal>Message</literal> becomes the payload. However, when the return value is not a <literal>Message</literal>, the new <literal>Message</literal> is constructed with the return value as the payload while inheriting
headers from the input <literal>Message</literal> minus the headers defined or filtered by <literal>SpringIntegrationProperties.messageHandlerNotPropagatedHeaders</literal>.
By default, there is only one header set there: <literal>contentType</literal>. This means that the new <literal>Message</literal> does not have <literal>contentType</literal> header set, thus ensuring that the <literal>contentType</literal> can evolve.
You can always opt out of returning a <literal>Message</literal> from the handler method where you can inject any header you wish.</simpara>
<simpara>If there is an internal pipeline, the <literal>Message</literal> is sent to the next handler by going through the same process of conversion. However, if there is no internal pipeline or you have reached the end of it, the <literal>Message</literal> is sent back to the output destination.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_content_type_versus_argument_type">
<title>Content Type versus Argument Type</title>
<simpara>As mentioned earlier, for the framework to select the appropriate <literal>MessageConverter</literal>, it requires argument type and, optionally, content type information.
The logic for selecting the appropriate <literal>MessageConverter</literal> resides with the argument resolvers (<literal>HandlerMethodArgumentResolvers</literal>), which trigger right before the invocation of the user-defined handler method (which is when the actual argument type is known to the framework).
If the argument type does not match the type of the current payload, the framework delegates to the stack of the
pre-configured <literal>MessageConverters</literal> to see if any one of them can convert the payload.
As you can see, the  <literal>Object fromMessage(Message&lt;?&gt; message, Class&lt;?&gt; targetClass);</literal>
operation of the MessageConverter takes <literal>targetClass</literal> as one of its arguments.
The framework also ensures that the provided <literal>Message</literal> always contains a <literal>contentType</literal> header.
When no contentType header was already present, it injects either the per-binding <literal>contentType</literal> header or the default <literal>contentType</literal> header.
The combination of <literal>contentType</literal> argument type is the mechanism by which framework determines if message can be converted to a target type.
If no appropriate <literal>MessageConverter</literal> is found, an exception is thrown, which you can handle by adding a custom <literal>MessageConverter</literal> (see <quote><xref linkend="spring-cloud-stream-overview-user-defined-message-converters"/></quote>).</simpara>
<simpara>But what if the payload type matches the target type declared by the handler method? In this case, there is nothing to convert, and the
payload is passed unmodified. While this sounds pretty straightforward and logical, keep in mind handler methods that take a <literal>Message&lt;?&gt;</literal> or <literal>Object</literal> as an argument.
By declaring the target type to be <literal>Object</literal> (which is an <literal>instanceof</literal> everything in Java), you essentially forfeit the conversion process.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Do not expect <literal>Message</literal> to be converted into some other type based only on the <literal>contentType</literal>.
Remember that the <literal>contentType</literal> is complementary to the target type.
If you wish, you can provide a hint, which <literal>MessageConverter</literal> may or may not take into consideration.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_message_converters">
<title>Message Converters</title>
<simpara><literal>MessageConverters</literal> define two methods:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">Object fromMessage(Message&lt;?&gt; message, Class&lt;?&gt; targetClass);

Message&lt;?&gt; toMessage(Object payload, @Nullable MessageHeaders headers);</programlisting>
<simpara>It is important to understand the contract of these methods and their usage, specifically in the context of Spring Cloud Stream.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>fromMessage</literal> method converts an incoming <literal>Message</literal> to an argument type.
The payload of the <literal>Message</literal> could be any type, and it is
up to the actual implementation of the <literal>MessageConverter</literal> to support multiple types.
For example, some JSON converter may support the payload type as <literal>byte[]</literal>, <literal>String</literal>, and others.
This is important when the application contains an internal pipeline (that is, input &#8594; handler1 &#8594; handler2 &#8594;. . . &#8594; output) and the output of the upstream handler results in a <literal>Message</literal> which may not be in the initial wire format.</simpara>
<simpara>However, the <literal>toMessage</literal> method has a more strict contract and must always convert <literal>Message</literal> to the wire format: <literal>byte[]</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>So, for all intents and purposes (and especially when implementing your own converter) you regard the two methods as having the following signatures:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">Object fromMessage(Message&lt;?&gt; message, Class&lt;?&gt; targetClass);

<chapter xml:id="schema-evolution">
<title>Schema Evolution Support</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides support for schema evolution so that the data can be evolved over time and still work with older or newer producers and consumers and vice versa.
Most serialization models, especially the ones that aim for portability across different platforms and languages, rely on a schema that describes how the data is serialized in the binary payload.
In order to serialize the data and then to interpret it, both the sending and receiving sides must have access to a schema that describes the binary format.
In certain cases, the schema can be inferred from the payload type on serialization or from the target type on deserialization.
However, many applications benefit from having access to an explicit schema that describes the binary data format.
A schema registry lets you store schema information in a textual format (typically JSON) and makes that information accessible to various applications that need it to receive and send data in binary format.
A schema is referenceable as a tuple consisting of:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>A subject that is the logical name of the schema</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The schema version</simpara>

<simpara>The schema format, which describes the binary format of the data</simpara>

<section xml:id="_schema_registry_client">
<title>Schema Registry Client</title>
<simpara>The client-side abstraction for interacting with schema registry servers is the <literal>SchemaRegistryClient</literal> interface, which has the following structure:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface SchemaRegistryClient {

    SchemaRegistrationResponse register(String subject, String format, String schema);

    String fetch(SchemaReference schemaReference);

    String fetch(Integer id);

}</programlisting>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides out-of-the-box implementations for interacting with its own schema server and for interacting with the Confluent Schema Registry.</simpara>
<simpara>A client for the Spring Cloud Stream schema registry can be configured by using the <literal>@EnableSchemaRegistryClient</literal>, as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">  @EnableBinding(Sink.class)
  @SpringBootApplication

<note>
<simpara>The default converter is optimized to cache not only the schemas from the remote server but also the <literal>parse()</literal> and <literal>toString()</literal> methods, which are quite expensive.
Because of this, it uses a <literal>DefaultSchemaRegistryClient</literal> that does not cache responses.
If you intend to change the default behavior, you can use the client directly on your code and override it to the desired outcome.

<title>Avro Schema Registry Client Message Converters</title>
<simpara>For applications that have a SchemaRegistryClient bean registered with the application context, Spring Cloud Stream auto configures an Apache Avro message converter for schema management.
This eases schema evolution, as applications that receive messages can get easy access to a writer schema that can be reconciled with their own reader schema.</simpara>
<simpara>For outbound messages, if the content type of the channel is set to <literal>application/*+avro</literal>, the <literal>MessageConverter</literal> is activated, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="properties" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.contentType=application/*+avro</programlisting>
<simpara>During the outbound conversion, the message converter tries to infer the schema of each outbound messages (based on its type) and register it to a subject (based on the payload type) by using the <literal>SchemaRegistryClient</literal>.
If an identical schema is already found, then a reference to it is retrieved.
If not, the schema is registered, and a new version number is provided.
The message is sent with a <literal>contentType</literal> header by using the following scheme: <literal>application/[prefix].[subject].v[version]+avro</literal>, where <literal>prefix</literal> is configurable and <literal>subject</literal> is deduced from the payload type.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, a message of the type <literal>User</literal> might be sent as a binary payload with a content type of <literal>application/vnd.user.v2+avro</literal>, where <literal>user</literal> is the subject and <literal>2</literal> is the version number.</simpara>
<simpara>When receiving messages, the converter infers the schema reference from the header of the incoming message and tries to retrieve it. The schema is used as the writer schema in the deserialization process.</simpara>

<title>Apache Avro Message Converters</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides support for schema-based message converters through its <literal>spring-cloud-stream-schema</literal> module.
Currently, the only serialization format supported out of the box for schema-based message converters is Apache Avro, with more formats to be added in future versions.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>spring-cloud-stream-schema</literal> module contains two types of message converters that can be used for Apache Avro serialization:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Converters that use the class information of the serialized or deserialized objects or a schema with a location known at startup.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Converters that use a schema registry. They locate the schemas at runtime and dynamically register new schemas as domain objects evolve.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>
<section xml:id="_converters_with_schema_support">
<title>Converters with Schema Support</title>
<simpara>The <literal>AvroSchemaMessageConverter</literal> supports serializing and deserializing messages either by using a predefined schema or by using the schema information available in the class (either reflectively or contained in the <literal>SpecificRecord</literal>).
If you provide a custom converter, then the default AvroSchemaMessageConverter bean is not created. The following example shows a custom converter:</simpara>
<simpara>To use custom converters, you can simply add it to the application context, optionally specifying one or more <literal>MimeTypes</literal> with which to associate it.
The default <literal>MimeType</literal> is <literal>application/avro</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>If the target type of the conversion is a <literal>GenericRecord</literal>, a schema must be set.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows how to configure a converter in a sink application by registering the Apache Avro <literal>MessageConverter</literal> without a predefined schema.
In this example, note that the mime type value is <literal>avro/bytes</literal>, not the default <literal>application/avro</literal>.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Sink.class)

public static class SinkApplication {

  ...

  @Bean
  public MessageConverter userMessageConverter() {
      return new AvroSchemaMessageConverter(MimeType.valueOf("avro/bytes"));
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Conversely, the following application registers a converter with a predefined schema (found on the classpath):</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
@SpringBootApplication
public static class SinkApplication {

  @Bean
  public MessageConverter userMessageConverter() {

      converter.setSchemaLocation(new ClassPathResource("schemas/User.avro"));
      return converter;
  }
}</programlisting>

<section xml:id="_schema_registry_server">
<title>Schema Registry Server</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides a schema registry server implementation.
To use it, you can add the <literal>spring-cloud-stream-schema-server</literal> artifact to your project and use the <literal>@EnableSchemaRegistryServer</literal> annotation, which adds the schema registry server REST controller to your application.
This annotation is intended to be used with Spring Boot web applications, and the listening port of the server is controlled by the <literal>server.port</literal> property.
The <literal>spring.cloud.stream.schema.server.path</literal> property can be used to control the root path of the schema server (especially when it is embedded in other applications).
The <literal>spring.cloud.stream.schema.server.allowSchemaDeletion</literal> boolean property enables the deletion of a schema. By default, this is disabled.</simpara>
<simpara>The schema registry server uses a relational database to store the schemas.
By default, it uses an embedded database.
You can customize the schema storage by using the <link xl:href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-sql">Spring Boot SQL database and JDBC configuration options</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows a Spring Boot application that enables the schema registry:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@EnableSchemaRegistryServer

<section xml:id="spring-cloud-stream-overview-schema-registration-process">
<title>Schema Registration Process (Serialization)</title>
<simpara>The first part of the registration process is extracting a schema from the payload that is being sent over a channel.
Avro types such as <literal>SpecificRecord</literal> or <literal>GenericRecord</literal> already contain a schema, which can be retrieved immediately from the instance.
In the case of POJOs, a schema is inferred if the <literal>spring.cloud.stream.schema.avro.dynamicSchemaGenerationEnabled</literal> property is set to <literal>true</literal> (the default).</simpara>

<simpara>Ones a schema is obtained, the converter loads its metadata (version) from the remote server.
First, it queries a local cache. If no result is found, it submits the data to the server, which replies with versioning information.
The converter always caches the results to avoid the overhead of querying the Schema Server for every new message that needs to be serialized.</simpara>

Spring Cloud Stream always fetches the writer schema to determine how to read a message.

<section xml:id="spring-cloud-stream-overview-connecting-multiple-application-instances">
<title>Connecting Multiple Application Instances</title>
<simpara>While Spring Cloud Stream makes it easy for individual Spring Boot applications to connect to messaging systems, the typical scenario for Spring Cloud Stream is the creation of multi-application pipelines, where microservice applications send data to each other.
You can achieve this scenario by correlating the input and output destinations of <quote>adjacent</quote> applications.</simpara>
<simpara>Suppose a design calls for the Time Source application to send data to the Log Sink application. You could use a common destination named <literal>ticktock</literal> for bindings within both applications.</simpara>
<simpara>Time Source (that has the channel name <literal>output</literal>) would set the following property:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.destination=ticktock</screen>
<simpara>Log Sink (that has the channel name <literal>input</literal>) would set the following property:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=ticktock</screen>
</section>
<section xml:id="spring-cloud-stream-overview-instance-index-instance-count">
<title>Instance Index and Instance Count</title>
<simpara>When scaling up Spring Cloud Stream applications, each instance can receive information about how many other instances of the same application exist and what its own instance index is.
Spring Cloud Stream does this through the <literal>spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount</literal> and <literal>spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex</literal> properties.
For example, if there are three instances of a HDFS sink application, all three instances have <literal>spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount</literal> set to <literal>3</literal>, and the individual applications have <literal>spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex</literal> set to <literal>0</literal>, <literal>1</literal>, and <literal>2</literal>, respectively.</simpara>
<simpara>When Spring Cloud Stream applications are deployed through Spring Cloud Data Flow, these properties are configured automatically; when Spring Cloud Stream applications are launched independently, these properties must be set correctly.
By default, <literal>spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount</literal> is <literal>1</literal>, and <literal>spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex</literal> is <literal>0</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>In a scaled-up scenario, correct configuration of these two properties is important for addressing partitioning behavior (see below) in general, and the two properties are always required by certain binders (for example, the Kafka binder) in order to ensure that data are split correctly across multiple consumer instances.</simpara>

</itemizedlist>
<section xml:id="spring-cloud-stream-overview-configuring-output-bindings-partitioning">
<title>Configuring Output Bindings for Partitioning</title>
<simpara>You can configure an output binding to send partitioned data by setting one and only one of its <literal>partitionKeyExpression</literal> or <literal>partitionKeyExtractorName</literal> properties, as well as its <literal>partitionCount</literal> property.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, the following is a valid and typical configuration:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionKeyExpression=payload.id
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionCount=5</screen>
<simpara>Based on that example configuration, data is sent to the target partition by using the following logic.</simpara>
<simpara>A partition key&#8217;s value is calculated for each message sent to a partitioned output channel based on the <literal>partitionKeyExpression</literal>.
The <literal>partitionKeyExpression</literal> is a SpEL expression that is evaluated against the outbound message for extracting the partitioning key.</simpara>
<simpara>If a SpEL expression is not sufficient for your needs, you can instead calculate the partition key value by providing an implementation of <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.PartitionKeyExtractorStrategy</literal> and configuring it as a bean (by using the <literal>@Bean</literal> annotation).
If you have more then one bean of type <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.PartitionKeyExtractorStrategy</literal> available in the Application Context, you can further filter it by specifying its name with the <literal>partitionKeyExtractorName</literal> property, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionKeyExtractorName=customPartitionKeyExtractor
--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionCount=5
. . .
@Bean
public CustomPartitionKeyExtractorClass customPartitionKeyExtractor() {
    return new CustomPartitionKeyExtractorClass();
}</screen>
<note>
<simpara>In previous versions of Spring Cloud Stream, you could specify the implementation of <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.PartitionKeyExtractorStrategy</literal> by setting the  <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionKeyExtractorClass</literal> property.
Since version 2.0, this property is deprecated, and support for it will be removed in a future version.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Once the message key is calculated, the partition selection process determines the target partition as a value between <literal>0</literal> and <literal>partitionCount - 1</literal>.
The default calculation, applicable in most scenarios, is based on the following formula: <literal>key.hashCode() % partitionCount</literal>.
This can be customized on the binding, either by setting a SpEL expression to be evaluated against the 'key' (through the <literal>partitionSelectorExpression</literal> property) or by configuring an implementation of <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.PartitionSelectorStrategy</literal> as a bean (by using the @Bean annotation).
Similar to the <literal>PartitionKeyExtractorStrategy</literal>, you can further filter it by using the <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionSelectorName</literal> property when more than one bean of this type is available in the Application Context, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionSelectorName=customPartitionSelector
. . .
@Bean
public CustomPartitionSelectorClass customPartitionSelector() {
    return new CustomPartitionSelectorClass();
}</screen>
<note>
<simpara>In previous versions of Spring Cloud Stream you could specify the implementation of <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.PartitionSelectorStrategy</literal> by setting the <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionSelectorClass</literal> property.
Since version 2.0, this property is deprecated and support for it will be removed in a future version.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="spring-cloud-stream-overview-configuring-input-bindings-partitioning">
<title>Configuring Input Bindings for Partitioning</title>
<simpara>An input binding (with the channel name <literal>input</literal>) is configured to receive partitioned data by setting its <literal>partitioned</literal> property, as well as the <literal>instanceIndex</literal> and <literal>instanceCount</literal> properties on the application itself, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.consumer.partitioned=true
spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex=3
spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount=5</screen>
<simpara>The <literal>instanceCount</literal> value represents the total number of application instances between which the data should be partitioned.
The <literal>instanceIndex</literal> must be a unique value across the multiple instances, with a value between <literal>0</literal> and <literal>instanceCount - 1</literal>.
The instance index helps each application instance to identify the unique partition(s) from which it receives data.
It is required by binders using technology that does not support partitioning natively.
For example, with RabbitMQ, there is a queue for each partition, with the queue name containing the instance index.
With Kafka, if <literal>autoRebalanceEnabled</literal> is <literal>true</literal> (default), Kafka takes care of distributing partitions across instances, and these properties are not required.
If <literal>autoRebalanceEnabled</literal> is set to false, the <literal>instanceCount</literal> and <literal>instanceIndex</literal> are used by the binder to determine which partition(s) the instance subscribes to (you must have at least as many partitions as there are instances).
The binder allocates the partitions instead of Kafka.
This might be useful if you want messages for a particular partition to always go to the same instance.
When a binder configuration requires them, it is important to set both values correctly in order to ensure that all of the data is consumed and that the application instances receive mutually exclusive datasets.</simpara>
<simpara>While a scenario in which using multiple instances for partitioned data processing may be complex to set up in a standalone case, Spring Cloud Dataflow can simplify the process significantly by populating both the input and output values correctly and by letting you rely on the runtime infrastructure to provide information about the instance index and instance count.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_testing">
<title>Testing</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides support for testing your microservice applications without connecting to a messaging system.
You can do that by using the <literal>TestSupportBinder</literal> provided by the <literal>spring-cloud-stream-test-support</literal> library, which can be added as a test dependency to the application, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">   &lt;dependency&gt;
       &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
       &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-stream-test-support&lt;/artifactId&gt;
       &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
   &lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>The <literal>TestSupportBinder</literal> uses the Spring Boot autoconfiguration mechanism to supersede the other binders found on the classpath.
Therefore, when adding a binder as a dependency, you must make sure that the <literal>test</literal> scope is being used.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>The <literal>TestSupportBinder</literal> lets you interact with the bound channels and inspect any messages sent and received by the application.</simpara>
<simpara>For outbound message channels, the <literal>TestSupportBinder</literal> registers a single subscriber and retains the messages emitted by the application in a <literal>MessageCollector</literal>.
They can be retrieved during tests and have assertions made against them.</simpara>
<simpara>You can also send messages to inbound message channels so that the consumer application can consume the messages.
The following example shows how to test both input and output channels on a processor:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment= SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
public class ExampleTest {

  @Autowired
  private Processor processor;

  @Autowired
  private MessageCollector messageCollector;

  @Test
  @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
  public void testWiring() {
    Message&lt;String&gt; message = new GenericMessage&lt;&gt;("hello");
    processor.input().send(message);
    Message&lt;String&gt; received = (Message&lt;String&gt;) messageCollector.forChannel(processor.output()).poll();
    assertThat(received.getPayload(), equalTo("hello world"));
  }


  @SpringBootApplication
  @EnableBinding(Processor.class)
  public static class MyProcessor {

    @Autowired
    private Processor channels;

    @Transformer(inputChannel = Processor.INPUT, outputChannel = Processor.OUTPUT)
    public String transform(String in) {
      return in + " world";
    }
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In the preceding example, we create an application that has an input channel and an output channel, both bound through the <literal>Processor</literal> interface.
The bound interface is injected into the test so that we can have access to both channels.
We send a message on the input channel, and we use the <literal>MessageCollector</literal> provided by Spring Cloud Stream&#8217;s test support to capture that the message has been sent to the output channel as a result.
Once we have received the message, we can validate that the component functions correctly.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_disabling_the_test_binder_autoconfiguration">
<title>Disabling the Test Binder Autoconfiguration</title>
<simpara>The intent behind the test binder superseding all the other binders on the classpath is to make it easy to test your applications without making changes to your production dependencies.
In some cases (for example, integration tests) it is useful to use the actual production binders instead, and that requires disabling the test binder autoconfiguration.
To do so, you can exclude the <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.test.binder.TestSupportBinderAutoConfiguration</literal> class by using one of the Spring Boot autoconfiguration exclusion mechanisms, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">    @SpringBootApplication(exclude = TestSupportBinderAutoConfiguration.class)
    @EnableBinding(Processor.class)
    public static class MyProcessor {

        @Transformer(inputChannel = Processor.INPUT, outputChannel = Processor.OUTPUT)
        public String transform(String in) {
            return in + " world";
        }
    }</programlisting>
<simpara>When autoconfiguration is disabled, the test binder is available on the classpath, and its <literal>defaultCandidate</literal> property is set to <literal>false</literal> so that it does not interfere with the regular user configuration. It can be referenced under the name, <literal>test</literal>, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<simpara><literal>spring.cloud.stream.defaultBinder=test</literal></simpara>

<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides support for emitting any available micrometer-based metrics to a binding destination, allowing for periodic

<simpara>Metrics Emitter is activated by defining the <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.applicationMetrics.destination</literal> property,
which specifies the name of the binding destination used by the current binder to publish metric messages.</simpara>
<simpara>For example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.cloud.stream.bindings.applicationMetrics.destination=myMetricDestination</programlisting>
<simpara>The preceding example instructs the binder to bind to <literal>myMetricDestination</literal> (that is, Rabbit exchange, Kafka topic, and others).</simpara>
<simpara>The following properties can be used for customizing the emission of metrics:</simpara>

<title>Usage</title>
<simpara>To use Apache Kafka binder, you need to add <literal>spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka</literal> as a dependency to your Spring Cloud Stream application, as shown in the following example for Maven:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Alternatively, you can also use the Spring Cloud Stream Kafka Starter, as shown inn the following example for Maven:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;

<simpara>The Apache Kafka Binder implementation maps each destination to an Apache Kafka topic.
The consumer group maps directly to the same Apache Kafka concept.
Partitioning also maps directly to Apache Kafka partitions as well.</simpara>
<simpara>The binder currently uses the Apache Kafka <literal>kafka-clients</literal> 1.0.0 jar and is designed to be used with a broker of at least that version.
This client can communicate with older brokers (see the Kafka documentation), but certain features may not be available.
For example, with versions earlier than 0.11.x.x, native headers are not supported.
Also, 0.11.x.x does not support the <literal>autoAddPartitions</literal> property.</simpara>

<simpara>The Kafka binder uses the <literal>partitionCount</literal> setting of the producer as a hint to create a topic with the given partition count (in conjunction with the <literal>minPartitionCount</literal>, the maximum of the two being the value being used).
Exercise caution when configuring both <literal>minPartitionCount</literal> for a binder and <literal>partitionCount</literal> for an application, as the larger value is used.
If a topic already exists with a smaller partition count and <literal>autoAddPartitions</literal> is disabled (the default), the binder fails to start.
If a topic already exists with a smaller partition count and <literal>autoAddPartitions</literal> is enabled, new partitions are added.

<simpara>For example, to set <literal>security.protocol</literal> to <literal>SASL_SSL</literal>, set the following property:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.configuration.security.protocol=SASL_SSL</screen>
<simpara>All the other security properties can be set in a similar manner.</simpara>
<simpara>When using Kerberos, follow the instructions in the <link xl:href="http://kafka.apache.org/090/documentation.html#security_sasl_clientconfig">reference documentation</link> for creating and referencing the JAAS configuration.</simpara>

<note>
<simpara>Do not mix JAAS configuration files and Spring Boot properties in the same application.
If the <literal>-Djava.security.auth.login.config</literal> system property is already present, Spring Cloud Stream ignores the Spring Boot properties.</simpara>

<note>
<simpara>Be careful when using the <literal>autoCreateTopics</literal> and <literal>autoAddPartitions</literal> with Kerberos.
Usually, applications may use principals that do not have administrative rights in Kafka and Zookeeper.
Consequently, relying on Spring Cloud Stream to create/modify topics may fail.
In secure environments, we strongly recommend creating topics and managing ACLs administratively by using Kafka tooling.</simpara>

<section xml:id="pause-resume">
<title>Example: Pausing and Resuming the Consumer</title>
<simpara>If you wish to suspend consumption but not cause a partition rebalance, you can pause and resume the consumer.
This is facilitated by adding the <literal>Consumer</literal> as a parameter to your <literal>@StreamListener</literal>.
To resume, you need an <literal>ApplicationListener</literal> for <literal>ListenerContainerIdleEvent</literal> instances.
The frequency at which events are published is controlled by the <literal>idleEventInterval</literal> property.
Since the consumer is not thread-safe, you must call these methods on the calling thread.</simpara>
<simpara>The following simple application shows how to pause and resume:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public class Application {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
	}

	@StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)
	public void in(String in, @Header(KafkaHeaders.CONSUMER) Consumer&lt;?, ?&gt; consumer) {
		System.out.println(in);
		consumer.pause(Collections.singleton(new TopicPartition("myTopic", 0)));
	}

	@Bean
	public ApplicationListener&lt;ListenerContainerIdleEvent&gt; idleListener() {
		return event -&gt; {
			System.out.println(event);

<section xml:id="kafka-error-channels">
<title>Error Channels</title>
<simpara>Starting with version 1.3, the binder unconditionally sends exceptions to an error channel for each consumer destination and can also be configured to send async producer send failures to an error channel.
See <xref linkend="spring-cloud-stream-overview-error-handling"/> for more information.</simpara>
<simpara>The payload of the <literal>ErrorMessage</literal> for a send failure is a <literal>KafkaSendFailureException</literal> with properties:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>failedMessage</literal>: The Spring Messaging <literal>Message&lt;?&gt;</literal> that failed to be sent.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>record</literal>: The raw <literal>ProducerRecord</literal> that was created from the <literal>failedMessage</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>There is no automatic handling of producer exceptions (such as sending to a <link linkend="kafka-dlq-processing">Dead-Letter queue</link>).
You can consume these exceptions with your own Spring Integration flow.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="kafka-metrics">
<title>Kafka Metrics</title>
<simpara>Kafka binder module exposes the following metrics:</simpara>
<simpara><literal>spring.cloud.stream.binder.kafka.offset</literal>: This metric indicates how many messages have not been yet consumed from a given binder&#8217;s topic by a given consumer group.
The metrics provided are based on the Mircometer metrics library. The metric contains the consumer group information, topic and the actual lag in committed offset from the latest offset on the topic.
This metric is particularly useful for providing auto-scaling feedback to a PaaS platform.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="kafka-dlq-processing">
<title>Dead-Letter Topic Processing</title>
<simpara>Because you cannot anticipate how users would want to dispose of dead-lettered messages, the framework does not provide any standard mechanism to handle them.
If the reason for the dead-lettering is transient, you may wish to route the messages back to the original topic.
However, if the problem is a permanent issue, that could cause an infinite loop.
The sample Spring Boot application within this topic is an example of how to route those messages back to the original topic, but it moves them to a <quote>parking lot</quote> topic after three attempts.
The application is another spring-cloud-stream application that reads from the dead-letter topic.
It terminates when no messages are received for 5 seconds.</simpara>
<simpara>The examples assume the original destination is <literal>so8400out</literal> and the consumer group is <literal>so8400</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>There are a couple of strategies to consider:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Consider running the rerouting only when the main application is not running.
Otherwise, the retries for transient errors are used up very quickly.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Alternatively, use a two-stage approach: Use this application to route to a third topic and another to route from there back to the main topic.</simpara>

<title>Usage</title>
<simpara>For using the Kafka Streams binder, you just need to add it to your Spring Cloud Stream application, using the following
Maven coordinates:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka-streams&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>

<title>Kafka Streams Binder Overview</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream&#8217;s Apache Kafka support also includes a binder implementation designed explicitly for Apache Kafka
Streams binding. With this native integration, a Spring Cloud Stream "processor" application can directly use the
<link xl:href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/developer-guide">Apache Kafka Streams</link> APIs in the core business logic.</simpara>
<simpara>Kafka Streams binder implementation builds on the foundation provided by the <link xl:href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/reference/html/_reference.html#kafka-streams">Kafka Streams in Spring Kafka</link>
project.</simpara>
<simpara>Kafka Streams binder provides binding capabilities for the three major types in Kafka Streams - KStream, KTable and GlobalKTable.</simpara>
<simpara>As part of this native integration, the high-level <link xl:href="https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/developer-guide/dsl-api.html">Streams DSL</link>
provided by the Kafka Streams API is available for use in the business logic.</simpara>
<simpara>An early version of the <link xl:href="https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/developer-guide/processor-api.html">Processor API</link>
support is available as well.</simpara>
<simpara>As noted early-on, Kafka Streams support in Spring Cloud Stream is strictly only available for use in the Processor model.
A model in which the messages read from an inbound topic, business processing can be applied, and the transformed messages
can be written to an outbound topic. It can also be used in Processor applications with a no-outbound destination.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_streams_dsl">
<title>Streams DSL</title>
<simpara>This application consumes data from a Kafka topic (e.g., <literal>words</literal>), computes word count for each unique word in a 5 seconds
time window, and the computed results are sent to a downstream topic (e.g., <literal>counts</literal>) for further processing.</simpara>
<screen>@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(KStreamProcessor.class)
public class WordCountProcessorApplication {

	@StreamListener("input")
	@SendTo("output")
	public KStream&lt;?, WordCount&gt; process(KStream&lt;?, String&gt; input) {
		return input
                .flatMapValues(value -&gt; Arrays.asList(value.toLowerCase().split("\\W+")))
                .groupBy((key, value) -&gt; value)
                .windowedBy(TimeWindows.of(5000))
                .count(Materialized.as("WordCounts-multi"))
                .toStream()
                .map((key, value) -&gt; new KeyValue&lt;&gt;(null, new WordCount(key.key(), value, new Date(key.window().start()), new Date(key.window().end()))));
    }

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(WordCountProcessorApplication.class, args);
	}</screen>
<simpara>Once built as a uber-jar (e.g., <literal>wordcount-processor.jar</literal>), you can run the above example like the following.</simpara>
<screen>java -jar wordcount-processor.jar  --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=words --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.destination=counts</screen>
<simpara>This application will consume messages from the Kafka topic <literal>words</literal> and the computed results are published to an output
topic <literal>counts</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream will ensure that the messages from both the incoming and outgoing topics are automatically bound as
KStream objects. As a developer, you can exclusively focus on the business aspects of the code, i.e. writing the logic
required in the processor. Setting up the Streams DSL specific configuration required by the Kafka Streams infrastructure
is automatically handled by the framework.</simpara>

<title>Multiple Input Bindings</title>
<simpara>For use cases that requires multiple incoming KStream objects or a combination of KStream and KTable objects, the Kafka
Streams binder provides multiple bindings support.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s see it in action.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_multiple_input_bindings_as_a_sink">
<title>Multiple Input Bindings as a Sink</title>
<screen>@EnableBinding(KStreamKTableBinding.class)
.....
.....
@StreamListener
public void process(@Input("inputStream") KStream&lt;String, PlayEvent&gt; playEvents,
                    @Input("inputTable") KTable&lt;Long, Song&gt; songTable) {

    @Input("inputStream")
    KStream&lt;?, ?&gt; inputStream();

    @Input("inputTable")
    KTable&lt;?, ?&gt; inputTable();
}</screen>
<simpara>In the above example, the application is written as a sink, i.e. there are no output bindings and the application has to
decide concerning downstream processing. When you write applications in this style, you might want to send the information
downstream or store them in a state store (See below for Queryable State Stores).</simpara>
<simpara>In the case of incoming KTable, if you want to materialize the computations to a state store, you have to express it
through the following property.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.inputTable.consumer.materializedAs: all-songs</screen>
<simpara>The above example shows the use of KTable as an input binding.
The binder also supports input bindings for GlobalKTable.
GlobalKTable binding is useful when you have to ensure that all instances of your application has access to the data updates from the topic.
KTable and GlobalKTable bindings are only available on the input.
Binder supports both input and output bindings for KStream.</simpara>

<title>Multiple Output Bindings (aka Branching)</title>
<simpara>Kafka Streams allow outbound data to be split into multiple topics based on some predicates. The Kafka Streams binder provides
support for this feature without compromising the programming model exposed through <literal>StreamListener</literal> in the end user application.</simpara>
<simpara>You can write the application in the usual way as demonstrated above in the word count example. However, when using the
branching feature, you are required to do a few things. First, you need to make sure that your return type is <literal>KStream[]</literal>
instead of a regular <literal>KStream</literal>. Second, you need to use the <literal>SendTo</literal> annotation containing the output bindings in the order
(see example below). For each of these output bindings, you need to configure destination, content-type etc., complying with
the standard Spring Cloud Stream expectations.</simpara>
<simpara>Here is an example:</simpara>
<screen>@EnableBinding(KStreamProcessorWithBranches.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class WordCountProcessorApplication {

    @Autowired
    private TimeWindows timeWindows;

    @StreamListener("input")
    @SendTo({"output1","output2","output3})
    public KStream&lt;?, WordCount&gt;[] process(KStream&lt;Object, String&gt; input) {

			Predicate&lt;Object, WordCount&gt; isEnglish = (k, v) -&gt; v.word.equals("english");
			Predicate&lt;Object, WordCount&gt; isFrench =  (k, v) -&gt; v.word.equals("french");
			Predicate&lt;Object, WordCount&gt; isSpanish = (k, v) -&gt; v.word.equals("spanish");

			return input
					.flatMapValues(value -&gt; Arrays.asList(value.toLowerCase().split("\\W+")))
					.groupBy((key, value) -&gt; value)
					.windowedBy(timeWindows)
					.count(Materialized.as("WordCounts-1"))
					.toStream()
					.map((key, value) -&gt; new KeyValue&lt;&gt;(null, new WordCount(key.key(), value, new Date(key.window().start()), new Date(key.window().end()))))

<section xml:id="_message_conversion">
<title>Message Conversion</title>
<simpara>Similar to message-channel based binder applications, the Kafka Streams binder adapts to the out-of-the-box content-type
conversions without any compromise.</simpara>
<simpara>It is typical for Kafka Streams operations to know the type of SerDe’s used to transform the key and value correctly.
Therefore, it may be more natural to rely on the SerDe facilities provided by the Apache Kafka Streams library itself at
the inbound and outbound conversions rather than using the content-type conversions offered by the framework.
On the other hand, you might be already familiar with the content-type conversion patterns provided by the framework, and
that, you&#8217;d like to continue using for inbound and outbound conversions.</simpara>
<simpara>Both the options are supported in the Kafka Streams binder implementation.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_outbound_serialization">
<title>Outbound serialization</title>
<simpara>If native encoding is disabled (which is the default), then the framework will convert the message using the contentType
set by the user (otherwise, the default <literal>application/json</literal> will be applied). It will ignore any SerDe set on the outbound
in this case for outbound serialization.</simpara>
<simpara>Here is the property to set the contentType on the outbound.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.contentType: application/json</screen>
<simpara>Here is the property to enable native encoding.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.nativeEncoding: true</screen>
<simpara>If native encoding is enabled on the output binding (user has to enable it as above explicitly), then the framework will
skip any form of automatic message conversion on the outbound. In that case, it will switch to the Serde set by the user.
The <literal>valueSerde</literal> property set on the actual output binding will be used. Here is an example.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.output.producer.valueSerde: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serdes$StringSerde</screen>
<simpara>If this property is not set, then it will use the "default" SerDe: <literal>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.configuration.default.value.serde</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>It is worth to mention that Kafka Streams binder does not serialize the keys on outbound - it simply relies on Kafka itself.
Therefore, you either have to specify the <literal>keySerde</literal> property on the binding or it will default to the application-wide common
<literal>keySerde</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Binding level key serde:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.output.producer.keySerde</screen>
<simpara>Common Key serde:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.configuration.default.key.serde</screen>
<simpara>If branching is used, then you need to use multiple output bindings. For example,</simpara>
<screen>interface KStreamProcessorWithBranches {

    		@Input("input")
    		KStream&lt;?, ?&gt; input();

    		@Output("output1")
    		KStream&lt;?, ?&gt; output1();

    		@Output("output2")
    		KStream&lt;?, ?&gt; output2();

    		@Output("output3")
    		KStream&lt;?, ?&gt; output3();
    	}</screen>
<simpara>If <literal>nativeEncoding</literal> is set, then you can set different SerDe&#8217;s on individual output bindings as below.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.output1.producer.valueSerde=IntegerSerde
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.output2.producer.valueSerde=StringSerde
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.output3.producer.valueSerde=JsonSerde</screen>
<simpara>Then if you have <literal>SendTo</literal> like this, @SendTo({"output1", "output2", "output3"}), the <literal>KStream[]</literal> from the branches are
applied with proper SerDe objects as defined above. If you are not enabling <literal>nativeEncoding</literal>, you can then set different
contentType values on the output bindings as below. In that case, the framework will use the appropriate message converter
to convert the messages before sending to Kafka.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output1.contentType: application/json
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output2.contentType: application/java-serialzied-object
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output3.contentType: application/octet-stream</screen>
</section>
<section xml:id="_inbound_deserialization">
<title>Inbound Deserialization</title>
<simpara>Similar rules apply to data deserialization on the inbound.</simpara>
<simpara>If native decoding is disabled (which is the default), then the framework will convert the message using the contentType
set by the user (otherwise, the default <literal>application/json</literal> will be applied). It will ignore any SerDe set on the inbound
in this case for inbound deserialization.</simpara>
<simpara>Here is the property to set the contentType on the inbound.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.contentType: application/json</screen>
<simpara>Here is the property to enable native decoding.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.nativeDecoding: true</screen>
<simpara>If native decoding is enabled on the input binding (user has to enable it as above explicitly), then the framework will
skip doing any message conversion on the inbound. In that case, it will switch to the SerDe set by the user. The <literal>valueSerde</literal>
property set on the actual output binding will be used. Here is an example.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.input.consumer.valueSerde: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serdes$StringSerde</screen>
<simpara>If this property is not set, it will use the default SerDe: <literal>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.configuration.default.value.serde</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>It is worth to mention that Kafka Streams binder does not deserialize the keys on inbound - it simply relies on Kafka itself.
Therefore, you either have to specify the <literal>keySerde</literal> property on the binding or it will default to the application-wide common
<literal>keySerde</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Binding level key serde:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.input.consumer.keySerde</screen>
<simpara>Common Key serde:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.configuration.default.key.serde</screen>
<simpara>As in the case of KStream branching on the outbound, the benefit of setting value SerDe per binding is that if you have
multiple input bindings (multiple KStreams object) and they all require separate value SerDe&#8217;s, then you can configure
them individually. If you use the common configuration approach, then this feature won&#8217;t be applicable.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_error_handling">
<title>Error Handling</title>
<simpara>Apache Kafka Streams provide the capability for natively handling exceptions from deserialization errors.
For details on this support, please see <link xl:href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-161%3A+streams+deserialization+exception+handlers">this</link>
Out of the box, Apache Kafka Streams provide two kinds of deserialization exception handlers - <literal>logAndContinue</literal> and <literal>logAndFail</literal>.
As the name indicates, the former will log the error and continue processing the next records and the latter will log the
error and fail. <literal>LogAndFail</literal> is the default deserialization exception handler.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_handling_deserialization_exceptions">
<title>Handling Deserialization Exceptions</title>
<simpara>Kafka Streams binder supports a selection of exception handlers through the following properties.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.serdeError: logAndContinue</screen>
<simpara>In addition to the above two deserialization exception handlers, the binder also provides a third one for sending the erroneous
records (poison pills) to a DLQ topic. Here is how you enable this DLQ exception handler.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.serdeError: sendToDlq</screen>
<simpara>When the above property is set, all the deserialization error records are automatically sent to the DLQ topic.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.input.consumer.dlqName: foo-dlq</screen>
<simpara>If this is set, then the error records are sent to the topic <literal>foo-dlq</literal>. If this is not set, then it will create a DLQ
topic with the name <literal>error.&lt;input-topic-name&gt;.&lt;group-name&gt;</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>A couple of things to keep in mind when using the exception handling feature in Kafka Streams binder.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>The property <literal>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.serdeError</literal> is applicable for the entire application. This implies
that if there are multiple <literal>StreamListener</literal> methods in the same application, this property is applied to all of them.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The exception handling for deserialization works consistently with native deserialization and framework provided message
conversion.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>
<section xml:id="_handling_non_deserialization_exceptions">
<title>Handling Non-Deserialization Exceptions</title>
<simpara>For general error handling in Kafka Streams binder, it is up to the end user applications to handle application level errors.
As a side effect of providing a DLQ for deserialization exception handlers, Kafka Streams binder provides a way to get
access to the DLQ sending bean directly from your application.
Once you get access to that bean, you can programmatically send any exception records from your application to the DLQ.</simpara>
<simpara>It continues to remain hard to robust error handling using the high-level DSL; Kafka Streams doesn&#8217;t natively support error
handling yet.</simpara>
<simpara>However, when you use the low-level Processor API in your application, there are options to control this behavior. See
below.</simpara>
<screen>@Autowired

<title>State Store</title>
<simpara>State store is created automatically by Kafka Streams when the DSL is used.
When processor API is used, you need to register a state store manually. In order to do so, you can use <literal>KafkaStreamsStateStore</literal> annotation.
You can specify the name and type of the store, flags to control log and disabling cache, etc.
Once the store is created by the binder during the bootstrapping phase, you can access this state store through the processor API.
Below are some primitives for doing this.</simpara>
<simpara>Creating a state store:</simpara>
<screen>@KafkaStreamsStateStore(name="mystate", type= KafkaStreamsStateStoreProperties.StoreType.WINDOW, lengthMs=300000)
public void process(KStream&lt;Object, Product&gt; input) {
    ...
}</screen>
<simpara>Accessing the state store:</simpara>
<screen>Processor&lt;Object, Product&gt;() {

    WindowStore&lt;Object, String&gt; state;

    @Override
    public void init(ProcessorContext processorContext) {
        state = (WindowStore)processorContext.getStateStore("mystate");
    }
    ...
}</screen>
</section>
<section xml:id="_interactive_queries">
<title>Interactive Queries</title>
<simpara>As part of the public Kafka Streams binder API, we expose a class called <literal>InteractiveQueryService</literal>.
You can access this as a Spring bean in your application. An easy way to get access to this bean from your application is to "autowire" the bean.</simpara>
<screen>@Autowired
private InteractiveQueryService interactiveQueryService;</screen>
<simpara>Once you gain access to this bean, then you can query for the particular state-store that you are interested. See below.</simpara>
<screen>ReadOnlyKeyValueStore&lt;Object, Object&gt; keyValueStore =
						interactiveQueryService.getQueryableStoreType("my-store", QueryableStoreTypes.keyValueStore());</screen>
<simpara>If there are multiple instances of the kafka streams application running, then before you can query them interactively, you need to identify which application instance hosts the key.
<literal>InteractiveQueryService</literal> API provides methods for identifying the host information.</simpara>
<simpara>In order for this to work, you must configure the property <literal>application.server</literal> as below:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.configuration.application.server: &lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</screen>
<simpara>Here are some code snippets:</simpara>
<screen>org.apache.kafka.streams.state.HostInfo hostInfo = interactiveQueryService.getHostInfo("store-name",
						key, keySerializer);

if (interactiveQueryService.getCurrentHostInfo().equals(hostInfo)) {

    //query from the store that is locally available
}
else {
    //query from the remote host
}</screen>

<section xml:id="_accessing_the_underlying_kafkastreams_object">
<title>Accessing the underlying KafkaStreams object</title>
<simpara><literal>StreamBuilderFactoryBean</literal> from spring-kafka that is responsible for constructing the <literal>KafkaStreams</literal> object can be accessed programmatically.
Each <literal>StreamBuilderFactoryBean</literal> is registered as <literal>stream-builder</literal> and appended with the <literal>StreamListener</literal> method name.
If your <literal>StreamListener</literal> method is named as <literal>process</literal> for example, the stream builder bean is named as <literal>stream-builder-process</literal>.
Since this is a factory bean, it should be accessed by prepending an ampersand (<literal>&amp;</literal>) when accessing it programmatically.
Following is an example and it assumes the <literal>StreamListener</literal> method is named as <literal>process</literal></simpara>
<screen>StreamsBuilderFactoryBean streamsBuilderFactoryBean = context.getBean("&amp;stream-builder-process", StreamsBuilderFactoryBean.class);
			KafkaStreams kafkaStreams = streamsBuilderFactoryBean.getKafkaStreams();</screen>

<section xml:id="_state_cleanup">
<title>State Cleanup</title>
<simpara>By default, the <literal>Kafkastreams.cleanup()</literal> method is called when the binding is stopped.
See <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/reference/html/_reference.html#_configuration">the Spring Kafka documentation</link>.
To modify this behavior simply add a single <literal>CleanupConfig</literal> <literal>@Bean</literal> (configured to clean up on start, stop, or neither) to the application context; the bean will be detected and wired into the factory bean.</simpara>

<title>RabbitMQ Binder</title>

<section xml:id="_usage_3">
<title>Usage</title>
<simpara>To use the RabbitMQ binder, you can add it to your Spring Cloud Stream application, by using the following Maven coordinates:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Alternatively, you can use the Spring Cloud Stream RabbitMQ Starter, as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-starter-stream-rabbit&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>

<title>RabbitMQ Binder Overview</title>
<simpara>The following simplified diagram shows how the RabbitMQ binder operates:</simpara>

</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>By default, the RabbitMQ Binder implementation maps each destination to a <literal>TopicExchange</literal>.
For each consumer group, a <literal>Queue</literal> is bound to that <literal>TopicExchange</literal>.
Each consumer instance has a corresponding RabbitMQ <literal>Consumer</literal> instance for its group&#8217;s <literal>Queue</literal>.
For partitioned producers and consumers, the queues are suffixed with the partition index and use the partition index as the routing key.
For anonymous consumers (those with no <literal>group</literal> property), an auto-delete queue (with a randomized unique name) is used.</simpara>
<simpara>By using the optional <literal>autoBindDlq</literal> option, you can configure the binder to create and configure dead-letter queues (DLQs) (and a dead-letter exchange <literal>DLX</literal>, as well as routing infrastructure).
By default, the dead letter queue has the name of the destination, appended with <literal>.dlq</literal>.
If retry is enabled (<literal>maxAttempts &gt; 1</literal>), failed messages are delivered to the DLQ after retries are exhausted.
If retry is disabled (<literal>maxAttempts = 1</literal>), you should set <literal>requeueRejected</literal> to <literal>false</literal> (the default) so that failed messages are routed to the DLQ, instead of being re-queued.
In addition, <literal>republishToDlq</literal> causes the binder to publish a failed message to the DLQ (instead of rejecting it).
This feature lets additional information (such as the stack trace in the <literal>x-exception-stacktrace</literal> header) be added to the message in headers.
This option does not need retry enabled.
You can republish a failed message after just one attempt.
Starting with version 1.2, you can configure the delivery mode of republished messages.
See the <link linkend="spring-cloud-stream-rabbit-republish-delivery-mode"><literal>republishDeliveryMode</literal> property</link>.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>Setting <literal>requeueRejected</literal> to <literal>true</literal> (with <literal>republishToDlq=false</literal> ) causes the message to be re-queued and redelivered continually, which is likely not what you want unless the reason for the failure is transient.
In general, you should enable retry within the binder by setting <literal>maxAttempts</literal> to greater than one or by setting <literal>republishToDlq</literal> to <literal>true</literal>.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>See <xref linkend="rabbit-binder-properties"/> for more information about these properties.</simpara>
<simpara>The framework does not provide any standard mechanism to consume dead-letter messages (or to re-route them back to the primary queue).
Some options are described in <xref linkend="rabbit-dlq-processing"/>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>When multiple RabbitMQ binders are used in a Spring Cloud Stream application, it is important to disable 'RabbitAutoConfiguration' to avoid the same configuration from <literal>RabbitAutoConfiguration</literal> being applied to the two binders.
You can exclude the class by using the <literal>@SpringBootApplication</literal> annotation.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Starting with version 2.0, the <literal>RabbitMessageChannelBinder</literal> sets the <literal>RabbitTemplate.userPublisherConnection</literal> property to <literal>true</literal> so that the non-transactional producers avoid deadlocks on consumers, which can happen if cached connections are blocked because of a <link xl:href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/memory.html">memory alarm</link> on the broker.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Currently, a <literal>multiplex</literal> consumer (a single consumer listening to multiple queues) is only supported for message-driven conssumers; polled consumers can only retrieve messages from a single queue.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_retry_with_the_rabbitmq_binder">
<title>Retry With the RabbitMQ Binder</title>
<simpara>When retry is enabled within the binder, the listener container thread is suspended for any back off periods that are configured.
This might be important when strict ordering is required with a single consumer. However, for other use cases, it prevents other messages from being processed on that thread.
An alternative to using binder retry is to set up dead lettering with time to live on the dead-letter queue (DLQ) as well as dead-letter configuration on the DLQ itself.
See <quote><xref linkend="rabbit-binder-properties"/></quote> for more information about the properties discussed here.
You can use the following example configuration to enable this feature:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Set <literal>autoBindDlq</literal> to <literal>true</literal>.
The binder create a DLQ.
Optionally, you can specify a name in <literal>deadLetterQueueName</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Set <literal>dlqTtl</literal> to the back off time you want to wait between redeliveries.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Set the <literal>dlqDeadLetterExchange</literal> to the default exchange.
Expired messages from the DLQ are routed to the original queue, because the default <literal>deadLetterRoutingKey</literal> is the queue name (<literal>destination.group</literal>).
Setting to the default exchange is achieved by setting the property with no value, as shown in the next example.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>To force a message to be dead-lettered, either throw an <literal>AmqpRejectAndDontRequeueException</literal> or set <literal>requeueRejected</literal> to <literal>true</literal> (the default) and throw any exception.</simpara>
<simpara>The loop continue without end, which is fine for transient problems, but you may want to give up after some number of attempts.
Fortunately, RabbitMQ provides the <literal>x-death</literal> header, which lets you determine how many cycles have occurred.</simpara>
<simpara>To acknowledge a message after giving up, throw an <literal>ImmediateAcknowledgeAmqpException</literal>.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_putting_it_all_together">
<title>Putting it All Together</title>
<simpara>The following configuration creates an exchange <literal>myDestination</literal> with queue <literal>myDestination.consumerGroup</literal> bound to a topic exchange with a wildcard routing key <literal>#</literal>:</simpara>
<screen>---
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=myDestination
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.group=consumerGroup
#disable binder retries
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.consumer.max-attempts=1
#dlx/dlq setup

spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.bindings.input.consumer.dlq-ttl=5000
spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.bindings.input.consumer.dlq-dead-letter-exchange=
---</screen>
<simpara>This configuration creates a DLQ bound to a direct exchange (<literal>DLX</literal>) with a routing key of <literal>myDestination.consumerGroup</literal>.
When messages are rejected, they are routed to the DLQ.
After 5 seconds, the message expires and is routed to the original queue by using the queue name as the routing key, as shown in the following example:</simpara>

<title>Error Channels</title>
<simpara>Starting with version 1.3, the binder unconditionally sends exceptions to an error channel for each consumer destination and can also be configured to send async producer send failures to an error channel.
See <quote><xref linkend="binder-error-channels"/></quote> for more information.</simpara>
<simpara>RabbitMQ has two types of send failures:</simpara>

<simpara>As well as enabling producer error channels (as described in <quote><xref linkend="binder-error-channels"/></quote>), the RabbitMQ binder only sends messages to the channels if the connection factory is appropriately configured, as follows:</simpara>

</section>
<section xml:id="rabbit-dlq-processing">
<title>Dead-Letter Queue Processing</title>
<simpara>Because you cannot anticipate how users would want to dispose of dead-lettered messages, the framework does not provide any standard mechanism to handle them.
If the reason for the dead-lettering is transient, you may wish to route the messages back to the original queue.
However, if the problem is a permanent issue, that could cause an infinite loop.
The following Spring Boot application shows an example of how to route those messages back to the original queue but moves them to a third <quote>parking lot</quote> queue after three attempts.
The second example uses the <link xl:href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2015/04/16/scheduling-messages-with-rabbitmq/">RabbitMQ Delayed Message Exchange</link> to introduce a delay to the re-queued message.
In this example, the delay increases for each attempt.
These examples use a <literal>@RabbitListener</literal> to receive messages from the DLQ.
You could also use <literal>RabbitTemplate.receive()</literal> in a batch process.</simpara>
<simpara>The examples assume the original destination is <literal>so8400in</literal> and the consumer group is <literal>so8400</literal>.</simpara>

<title>Spring Cloud Bus</title>
<partintro>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Bus links the nodes of a distributed system with a lightweight message
broker. This broker can then be used to broadcast state changes (such as configuration
changes) or other management instructions. A key idea is that the bus is like a
distributed actuator for a Spring Boot application that is scaled out. However, it can
also be used as a communication channel between apps. This project provides starters for
either an AMQP broker or Kafka as the transport.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Spring Cloud is released under the non-restrictive Apache 2.0 license. If you would like to contribute to this section of the documentation or if you find an error, please find the source code and issue trackers in the project at <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config/tree/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc">github</link>.</simpara>
</note>
</partintro>
<chapter xml:id="_quick_start_3">
<title>Quick Start</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Bus works by adding Spring Boot autconfiguration if it detects itself on the
classpath. To enable the bus, add <literal>spring-cloud-starter-bus-amqp</literal> or
<literal>spring-cloud-starter-bus-kafka</literal> to your dependency management. Spring Cloud takes care of
the rest. Make sure the broker (RabbitMQ or Kafka) is available and configured. When
running on localhost, you need not do anything. If you run remotely, use Spring Cloud
Connectors or Spring Boot conventions to define the broker credentials, as shown in the
following example for Rabbit:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>spring:
  rabbitmq:
    host: mybroker.com
    port: 5672
    username: user
    password: secret</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>The bus currently supports sending messages to all nodes listening or all nodes for a
particular service (as defined by Eureka). The <literal>/bus/*</literal> actuator namespace has some HTTP
endpoints. Currently, two are implemented. The first, <literal>/bus/env</literal>, sends key/value pairs to
update each node&#8217;s Spring Environment. The second, <literal>/bus/refresh</literal>, reloads each
application&#8217;s configuration, as though they had all been pinged on their <literal>/refresh</literal>
endpoint.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The Spring Cloud Bus starters cover Rabbit and Kafka, because those are the two most
common implementations. However, Spring Cloud Stream is quite flexible, and the binder
works with <literal>spring-cloud-bus</literal>.</simpara>

</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_bus_endpoints">

<title>Addressing an Instance</title>
<simpara>Each instance of the application has a service ID, whose value can be set with
<literal>spring.cloud.bus.id</literal> and whose value is expected to be a colon-separated list of
identifiers, in order from least specific to most specific. The default value is
constructed from the environment as a combination of the <literal>spring.application.name</literal> and
<literal>server.port</literal> (or <literal>spring.application.index</literal>, if set). The default value of the ID is
constructed in the form of <literal>app:index:id</literal>, where:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>app</literal> is the <literal>vcap.application.name</literal>, if it exists, or <literal>spring.application.name</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>index</literal> is the <literal>vcap.application.instance_index</literal>, if it exists,
<literal>spring.application.index</literal>, <literal>local.server.port</literal>, <literal>server.port</literal>, or <literal>0</literal> (in that order).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>id</literal> is the <literal>vcap.application.instance_id</literal>, if it exists, or a random value.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The HTTP endpoints accept a <quote>destination</quote> path parameter, such as
<literal>/bus-refresh/customers:9000</literal>, where <literal>destination</literal> is a service ID. If the ID
is owned by an instance on the bus, it processes the message, and all other instances
ignore it.</simpara>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_addressing_all_instances_of_a_service">
<title>Addressing All Instances of a Service</title>
<simpara>The <quote>destination</quote> parameter is used in a Spring <literal>PathMatcher</literal> (with the path separator
as a colon&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;<literal>:</literal>) to determine if an instance processes the message. Using the example
from earlier, <literal>/bus-env/customers:**</literal> targets all instances of the
<quote>customers</quote> service regardless of the rest of the service ID.</simpara>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_service_id_must_be_unique">
<title>Service ID Must Be Unique</title>
<simpara>The bus tries twice to eliminate processing an event&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;once from the original
<literal>ApplicationEvent</literal> and once from the queue. To do so, it checks the sending service ID
against the current service ID. If multiple instances of a service have the same ID,
events are not processed. When running on a local machine, each service is on a different
port, and that port is part of the ID. Cloud Foundry supplies an index to differentiate.
To ensure that the ID is unique outside Cloud Foundry, set <literal>spring.application.index</literal> to
something unique for each instance of a service.</simpara>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_customizing_the_message_broker">
<title>Customizing the Message Broker</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Bus uses <link xl:href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream">Spring Cloud Stream</link> to
broadcast the messages. So, to get messages to flow, you need only include the binder
implementation of your choice in the classpath. There are convenient starters for the bus
with AMQP (RabbitMQ) and Kafka (<literal>spring-cloud-starter-bus-[amqp|kafka]</literal>). Generally
speaking, Spring Cloud Stream relies on Spring Boot autoconfiguration conventions for
configuring middleware. For instance, the AMQP broker address can be changed with
<literal>spring.rabbitmq.*</literal> configuration properties. Spring Cloud Bus has a handful of
native configuration properties in <literal>spring.cloud.bus.*</literal> (for example,
<literal>spring.cloud.bus.destination</literal> is the name of the topic to use as the external
middleware). Normally, the defaults suffice.</simpara>
<simpara>To learn more about how to customize the message broker settings, consult the Spring Cloud
Stream documentation.</simpara>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_tracing_bus_events">
<title>Tracing Bus Events</title>
<simpara>Bus events (subclasses of <literal>RemoteApplicationEvent</literal>) can be traced by setting
<literal>spring.cloud.bus.trace.enabled=true</literal>. If you do so, the Spring Boot <literal>TraceRepository</literal>
(if it is present) shows each event sent and all the acks from each service instance. The
following example comes from the <literal>/trace</literal> endpoint:</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
  "timestamp": "2015-11-26T10:24:44.411+0000",
  "info": {

    "origin": "customers:9000",
    "destination": "*:**"
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The preceding trace shows that a <literal>RefreshRemoteApplicationEvent</literal> was sent from
<literal>customers:9000</literal>, broadcast to all services, and received (acked) by <literal>customers:9000</literal> and
<literal>stores:8081</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To handle the ack signals yourself, you could add an <literal>@EventListener</literal> for the
<literal>AckRemoteApplicationEvent</literal> and <literal>SentApplicationEvent</literal> types to your app (and enable
tracing). Alternatively, you could tap into the <literal>TraceRepository</literal> and mine the data from
there.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Any Bus application can trace acks. However, sometimes, it is
useful to do this in a central service that can do more complex
queries on the data or forward it to a specialized tracing service.</simpara>
</note>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_broadcasting_your_own_events">
<title>Broadcasting Your Own Events</title>
<simpara>The Bus can carry any event of type <literal>RemoteApplicationEvent</literal>. The default transport is
JSON, and the deserializer needs to know which types are going to be used ahead of time.
To register a new type, you must put it in a subpackage of
<literal>org.springframework.cloud.bus.event</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To customise the event name, you can use <literal>@JsonTypeName</literal> on your custom class or rely on
the default strategy, which is to use the simple name of the class.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Both the producer and the consumer need access to the class definition.</simpara>
</note>
<section xml:id="_registering_events_in_custom_packages">
<title>Registering events in custom packages</title>
<simpara>If you cannot or do not want to use a subpackage of <literal>org.springframework.cloud.bus.event</literal>
for your custom events, you must specify which packages to scan for events of type
<literal>RemoteApplicationEvent</literal> by using the <literal>@RemoteApplicationEventScan</literal> annotation. Packages
specified with <literal>@RemoteApplicationEventScan</literal> include subpackages.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, consider the following custom event, called <literal>MyEvent</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">package com.acme;

public class MyEvent extends RemoteApplicationEvent {
    ...
}</programlisting>
<simpara>You can register that event with the deserializer in the following way:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">package com.acme;

@Configuration
@RemoteApplicationEventScan
public class BusConfiguration {
    ...
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Without specifying a value, the package of the class where <literal>@RemoteApplicationEventScan</literal>
is used is registered. In this example, <literal>com.acme</literal> is registered by using the package of
<literal>BusConfiguration</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>You can also explicitly specify the packages to scan by using the <literal>value</literal>, <literal>basePackages</literal>
or <literal>basePackageClasses</literal> properties on <literal>@RemoteApplicationEventScan</literal>, as shown in the
following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">package com.acme;

@Configuration
//@RemoteApplicationEventScan({"com.acme", "foo.bar"})
//@RemoteApplicationEventScan(basePackages = {"com.acme", "foo.bar", "fizz.buzz"})
@RemoteApplicationEventScan(basePackageClasses = BusConfiguration.class)
public class BusConfiguration {
    ...
}</programlisting>
<simpara>All of the preceding examples of <literal>@RemoteApplicationEventScan</literal> are equivalent, in that the
<literal>com.acme</literal> package is registered by explicitly specifying the packages on
<literal>@RemoteApplicationEventScan</literal>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>You can specify multiple base packages to scan.</simpara>

<note>
<simpara>When you pick a particular trace, you see merged spans.
That means that, if there were two spans sent to Zipkin with Server Received and Server Sent or Client Received and Client Sent annotations, they are presented as a single span.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Why is there a difference between the seven and four spans in this case?</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>One span comes from the <literal>http:/start</literal> span. It has the Server Received (<literal>sr</literal>) and Server Sent (<literal>ss</literal>) annotations.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Two spans come from the RPC call from <literal>service1</literal> to <literal>service2</literal> to the <literal>http:/foo</literal> endpoint.
The Client Sent (<literal>cs</literal>) and Client Received (<literal>cr</literal>) events took place on the <literal>service1</literal> side.
Server Received (<literal>sr</literal>) and Server Sent (<literal>ss</literal>) events took place on the <literal>service2</literal> side.
These two spans form one logical span related to an RPC call.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Two spans come from the RPC call from <literal>service2</literal> to <literal>service3</literal> to the <literal>http:/bar</literal> endpoint.
The Client Sent (<literal>cs</literal>) and Client Received (<literal>cr</literal>) events took place on the <literal>service2</literal> side.
The Server Received (<literal>sr</literal>) and Server Sent (<literal>ss</literal>) events took place on the <literal>service3</literal> side.
These two spans form one logical span related to an RPC call.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Two spans come from the RPC call from <literal>service2</literal> to <literal>service4</literal> to the <literal>http:/baz</literal> endpoint.
The Client Sent (<literal>cs</literal>) and Client Received (<literal>cr</literal>) events took place on the <literal>service2</literal> side.
Server Received (<literal>sr</literal>) and Server Sent (<literal>ss</literal>) events took place on the <literal>service4</literal> side.
These two spans form one logical span related to an RPC call.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>So, if we count the physical spans, we have one from <literal>http:/start</literal>, two from <literal>service1</literal> calling <literal>service2</literal>, two from <literal>service2</literal>
calling <literal>service3</literal>, and two from <literal>service2</literal> calling <literal>service4</literal>. In sum, we have a total of seven spans.</simpara>
<simpara>Logically, we see the information of four total Spans because we have one span related to the incoming request
to <literal>service1</literal> and three spans related to RPC calls.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_visualizing_errors">
<title>Visualizing errors</title>
<simpara>Zipkin lets you visualize errors in your trace.
When an exception was thrown and was not caught, we set proper tags on the span, which Zipkin can then properly colorize.
You could see in the list of traces one trace that is red. That appears because an exception was thrown.</simpara>
<simpara>If you click that trace, you see a similar picture, as follows:</simpara>

<title>Distributed Tracing with Brave</title>
<simpara>Starting with version <literal>2.0.0</literal>, Spring Cloud Sleuth uses <link xl:href="https://github.com/openzipkin/brave">Brave</link> as the tracing library.
Consequently, Sleuth no longer takes care of storing the context but delegates that work to Brave.</simpara>
<simpara>Due to the fact that Sleuth had different naming and tagging conventions than Brave, we decided to follow Brave&#8217;s conventions from now on.
However, if you want to use the legacy Sleuth approaches, you can set the <literal>spring.sleuth.http.legacy.enabled</literal> property to <literal>true</literal>.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_propagating_span_context">
<title>Propagating Span Context</title>
<simpara>The span context is the state that must get propagated to any child spans across process boundaries.
Part of the Span Context is the Baggage. The trace and span IDs are a required part of the span context.
Baggage is an optional part.</simpara>
<simpara>Baggage is a set of key:value pairs stored in the span context.
Baggage travels together with the trace and is attached to every span.
Spring Cloud Sleuth understands that a header is baggage-related if the HTTP header is prefixed with <literal>baggage-</literal> and, for messaging, it starts with <literal>baggage_</literal>.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>There is currently no limitation of the count or size of baggage items.
However, keep in mind that too many can decrease system throughput or increase RPC latency.
In extreme cases, too much baggage can crash the application, due to exceeding transport-level message or header capacity.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>The following example shows setting baggage on a span:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">Span initialSpan = this.tracer.nextSpan().name("span").start();
ExtraFieldPropagation.set(initialSpan.context(), "foo", "bar");
ExtraFieldPropagation.set(initialSpan.context(), "UPPER_CASE", "someValue");</programlisting>
<section xml:id="_baggage_versus_span_tags">
<title>Baggage versus Span Tags</title>
<simpara>Baggage travels with the trace (every child span contains the baggage of its parent).
Zipkin has no knowledge of baggage and does not receive that information.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>Starting from Sleuth 2.0.0 you have to pass the baggage key names explicitly
in your project configuration. Read more about that setup <link linkend="prefixed-fields">here</link></simpara>
</important>
<simpara>Tags are attached to a specific span. In other words, they are presented only for that particular span.
However, you can search by tag to find the trace, assuming a span having the searched tag value exists.</simpara>
<simpara>If you want to be able to lookup a span based on baggage, you should add a corresponding entry as a tag in the root span.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>The span must be in scope.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_introduction_to_brave">
<title>Introduction to Brave</title>
<important>
<simpara>Starting with version <literal>2.0.0</literal>, Spring Cloud Sleuth uses
<link xl:href="https://github.com/openzipkin/brave">Brave</link> as the tracing library.
For your convenience, we embed part of the Brave&#8217;s docs here.</simpara>
</important>
<important>
<simpara>In the vast majority of cases you need to just use the <literal>Tracer</literal>
or <literal>SpanCustomizer</literal> beans from Brave that Sleuth provides. The documentation below contains
a high overview of what Brave is and how it works.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>Brave is a library used to capture and report latency information about distributed operations to Zipkin.
Most users do not use Brave directly. They use libraries or frameworks rather than employ Brave on their behalf.</simpara>
<simpara>This module includes a tracer that creates and joins spans that model the latency of potentially distributed work.
It also includes libraries to propagate the trace context over network boundaries (for example, with HTTP headers).</simpara>
<section xml:id="_tracing">
<title>Tracing</title>
<simpara>Most importantly, you need a <literal>brave.Tracer</literal>, configured to <link xl:href="https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java">report to Zipkin</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example setup sends trace data (spans) to Zipkin over HTTP (as opposed to Kafka):</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">class MyClass {

    private final Tracer tracer;

    // Tracer will be autowired
    MyClass(Tracer tracer) {
        this.tracer = tracer;
    }

    void doSth() {
        Span span = tracer.newTrace().name("encode").start();
        // ...
    }
}</programlisting>
<important>
<simpara>If your span contains a name longer than 50 chars, then that name is truncated to 50 chars.
Your names have to be explicit and concrete.
Big names lead to latency issues and sometimes even thrown exceptions.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>The tracer creates and joins spans that model the latency of potentially distributed work.
It can employ sampling to reduce overhead during the process, to reduce the amount of data sent to Zipkin, or both.</simpara>
<simpara>Spans returned by a tracer report data to Zipkin when finished or do nothing if unsampled.
After starting a span, you can annotate events of interest or add tags containing details or lookup keys.</simpara>
<simpara>Spans have a context that includes trace identifiers that place the span at the correct spot in the tree representing the distributed operation.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_local_tracing">
<title>Local Tracing</title>
<simpara>When tracing code that never leaves your process, run it inside a scoped span.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowired Tracer tracer;

// Start a new trace or a span within an existing trace representing an operation
ScopedSpan span = tracer.startScopedSpan("encode");
try {
  // The span is in "scope" meaning downstream code such as loggers can see trace IDs
  return encoder.encode();
} catch (RuntimeException | Error e) {
  span.error(e); // Unless you handle exceptions, you might not know the operation failed!
  throw e;
} finally {
  span.finish(); // always finish the span
}</programlisting>
<simpara>When you need more features, or finer control, use the <literal>Span</literal> type:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowired Tracer tracer;

// Start a new trace or a span within an existing trace representing an operation
Span span = tracer.nextSpan().name("encode").start();
// Put the span in "scope" so that downstream code such as loggers can see trace IDs
try (SpanInScope ws = tracer.withSpanInScope(span)) {
  return encoder.encode();
} catch (RuntimeException | Error e) {
  span.error(e); // Unless you handle exceptions, you might not know the operation failed!
  throw e;
} finally {
  span.finish(); // note the scope is independent of the span. Always finish a span.
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Both of the above examples report the exact same span on finish!</simpara>
<simpara>In the above example, the span will be either a new root span or the
next child in an existing trace.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_customizing_spans">
<title>Customizing Spans</title>
<simpara>Once you have a span, you can add tags to it.
The tags can be used as lookup keys or details.
For example, you might add a tag with your runtime version, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">span.tag("clnt/finagle.version", "6.36.0");</programlisting>
<simpara>When exposing the ability to customize spans to third parties, prefer <literal>brave.SpanCustomizer</literal> as opposed to <literal>brave.Span</literal>.
The former is simpler to understand and test and does not tempt users with span lifecycle hooks.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">interface MyTraceCallback {
  void request(Request request, SpanCustomizer customizer);
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Since <literal>brave.Span</literal> implements <literal>brave.SpanCustomizer</literal>, you can pass it to users, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">for (MyTraceCallback callback : userCallbacks) {
  callback.request(request, span);
}</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_implicitly_looking_up_the_current_span">
<title>Implicitly Looking up the Current Span</title>
<simpara>Sometimes, you do not know if a trace is in progress or not, and you do not want users to do null checks.
<literal>brave.CurrentSpanCustomizer</literal> handles this problem by adding data to any span that&#8217;s in progress or drops, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<simpara>Ex.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// The user code can then inject this without a chance of it being null.
@Autowired SpanCustomizer span;

void userCode() {
  span.annotate("tx.started");
  ...
}</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_rpc_tracing">
<title>RPC tracing</title>
<tip>
<simpara>Check for <link xl:href="https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/tree/master/instrumentation">instrumentation written here</link> and <link xl:href="https://zipkin.io/pages/existing_instrumentations.html">Zipkin&#8217;s list</link> before rolling your own RPC instrumentation.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>RPC tracing is often done automatically by interceptors. Behind the scenes, they add tags and events that relate to their role in an RPC operation.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows how to add a client span:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowired Tracing tracing;
@Autowired Tracer tracer;

// before you send a request, add metadata that describes the operation
span = tracer.nextSpan().name(service + "/" + method).kind(CLIENT);
span.tag("myrpc.version", "1.0.0");
span.remoteServiceName("backend");
span.remoteIpAndPort("172.3.4.1", 8108);

// Add the trace context to the request, so it can be propagated in-band
tracing.propagation().injector(Request::addHeader)
                     .inject(span.context(), request);

// when the request is scheduled, start the span
span.start();

// if there is an error, tag the span
span.tag("error", error.getCode());
// or if there is an exception
span.error(exception);

// when the response is complete, finish the span
span.finish();</programlisting>
<section xml:id="_one_way_tracing">
<title>One-Way tracing</title>
<simpara>Sometimes, you need to model an asynchronous operation where there is a
request but no response. In normal RPC tracing, you use <literal>span.finish()</literal>
to indicate that the response was received. In one-way tracing, you use
<literal>span.flush()</literal> instead, as you do not expect a response.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows how a client might model a one-way operation:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowired Tracing tracing;
@Autowired Tracer tracer;

// start a new span representing a client request
oneWaySend = tracer.nextSpan().name(service + "/" + method).kind(CLIENT);

// Add the trace context to the request, so it can be propagated in-band
tracing.propagation().injector(Request::addHeader)
                     .inject(oneWaySend.context(), request);

// fire off the request asynchronously, totally dropping any response
request.execute();

// start the client side and flush instead of finish
oneWaySend.start().flush();</programlisting>
<simpara>The following example shows how a server might handle a one-way operation:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowired Tracing tracing;
@Autowired Tracer tracer;

// pull the context out of the incoming request
extractor = tracing.propagation().extractor(Request::getHeader);

// convert that context to a span which you can name and add tags to
oneWayReceive = nextSpan(tracer, extractor.extract(request))
    .name("process-request")
    .kind(SERVER)
    ... add tags etc.

// start the server side and flush instead of finish
oneWayReceive.start().flush();

// you should not modify this span anymore as it is complete. However,
// you can create children to represent follow-up work.
next = tracer.newSpan(oneWayReceive.context()).name("step2").start();</programlisting>
</section>
</section>
</section>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_sampling">
<title>Sampling</title>
<simpara>Sampling may be employed to reduce the data collected and reported out of process.
When a span is not sampled, it adds no overhead (a noop).</simpara>
<simpara>Sampling is an up-front decision, meaning that the decision to report data is made at the first operation in a trace and that decision is propagated downstream.</simpara>
<simpara>By default, a global sampler applies a single rate to all traced operations.
<literal>Tracer.Builder.sampler</literal> controls this setting, and it defaults to tracing every request.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_declarative_sampling">
<title>Declarative sampling</title>
<simpara>Some applications need to sample based on the type or annotations of a java method.</simpara>
<simpara>Most users use a framework interceptor to automate this sort of policy.
The following example shows how that might work internally:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowired Tracer tracer;

// derives a sample rate from an annotation on a java method
DeclarativeSampler&lt;Traced&gt; sampler = DeclarativeSampler.create(Traced::sampleRate);

@Around("@annotation(traced)")
public Object traceThing(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp, Traced traced) throws Throwable {
  // When there is no trace in progress, this decides using an annotation
  Sampler decideUsingAnnotation = declarativeSampler.toSampler(traced);
  Tracer tracer = tracer.withSampler(decideUsingAnnotation);

  // This code looks the same as if there was no declarative override
  ScopedSpan span = tracer.startScopedSpan(spanName(pjp));
  try {
    return pjp.proceed();
  } catch (RuntimeException | Error e) {
    span.error(e);
    throw e;
  } finally {
    span.finish();
  }
}</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_custom_sampling">
<title>Custom sampling</title>
<simpara>Depending on what the operation is, you may want to apply different policies.
For example, you might not want to trace requests to static resources such as images, or you might want to trace all requests to a new api.</simpara>
<simpara>Most users use a framework interceptor to automate this sort of policy.
The following example shows how that might work internally:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowired Tracer tracer;
@Autowired Sampler fallback;

Span nextSpan(final Request input) {
  Sampler requestBased = Sampler() {
    @Override public boolean isSampled(long traceId) {
      if (input.url().startsWith("/experimental")) {
        return true;
      } else if (input.url().startsWith("/static")) {
        return false;
      }
      return fallback.isSampled(traceId);
    }
  };
  return tracer.withSampler(requestBased).nextSpan();
}</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_sampling_in_spring_cloud_sleuth">
<title>Sampling in Spring Cloud Sleuth</title>
<simpara>By default Spring Cloud Sleuth sets all spans to non-exportable.
That means that traces appear in logs but not in any remote store.
For testing the default is often enough, and it probably is all you need if you use only the logs (for example, with an ELK aggregator).
If you export span data to Zipkin, there is also an <literal>Sampler.ALWAYS_SAMPLE</literal> setting that exports everything and a <literal>ProbabilityBasedSampler</literal> setting that samples a fixed fraction of spans.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The <literal>ProbabilityBasedSampler</literal> is the default if you use <literal>spring-cloud-sleuth-zipkin</literal>.
You can configure the exports by setting <literal>spring.sleuth.sampler.probability</literal>.
The passed value needs to be a double from <literal>0.0</literal> to <literal>1.0</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>A sampler can be installed by creating a bean definition, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public Sampler defaultSampler() {
	return Sampler.ALWAYS_SAMPLE;
}</programlisting>
<tip>
<simpara>You can set the HTTP header <literal>X-B3-Flags</literal> to <literal>1</literal>, or, when doing messaging, you can set the <literal>spanFlags</literal> header to <literal>1</literal>.
Doing so forces the current span to be exportable regardless of the sampling decision.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>In order to use the rate-limited sampler set the <literal>spring.sleuth.sampler.rate</literal> property to choose an amount of traces to accept on a per-second interval. The minimum number is 0 and the max is 2,147,483,647 (max int).</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_propagation">
<title>Propagation</title>
<simpara>Propagation is needed to ensure activities originating from the same root are collected together in the same trace.
The most common propagation approach is to copy a trace context from a client by sending an RPC request to a server receiving it.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, when a downstream HTTP call is made, its trace context is encoded as request headers and sent along with it, as shown in the following image:</simpara>
<screen>   Client Span                                                Server Span

<simpara>The names above are from <link xl:href="https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation">B3 Propagation</link>, which is built-in to Brave and has implementations in many languages and frameworks.</simpara>
<simpara>Most users use a framework interceptor to automate propagation.
The next two examples show how that might work for a client and a server.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows how client-side propagation might work:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowired Tracing tracing;

// configure a function that injects a trace context into a request
injector = tracing.propagation().injector(Request.Builder::addHeader);

// before a request is sent, add the current span's context to it
injector.inject(span.context(), request);</programlisting>
<simpara>The following example shows how server-side propagation might work:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowired Tracing tracing;
@Autowired Tracer tracer;

// configure a function that extracts the trace context from a request
extractor = tracing.propagation().extractor(Request::getHeader);

// when a server receives a request, it joins or starts a new trace
span = tracer.nextSpan(extractor.extract(request));</programlisting>
<section xml:id="_propagating_extra_fields">
<title>Propagating extra fields</title>
<simpara>Sometimes you need to propagate extra fields, such as a request ID or an alternate trace context.
For example, if you are in a Cloud Foundry environment, you might want to pass the request ID, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// when you initialize the builder, define the extra field you want to propagate
Tracing.newBuilder().propagationFactory(
  ExtraFieldPropagation.newFactory(B3Propagation.FACTORY, "x-vcap-request-id")
);

// later, you can tag that request ID or use it in log correlation
requestId = ExtraFieldPropagation.get("x-vcap-request-id");</programlisting>
<simpara>You may also need to propagate a trace context that you are not using.
For example, you may be in an Amazon Web Services environment but not be reporting data to X-Ray.
To ensure X-Ray can co-exist correctly, pass-through its tracing header, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">tracingBuilder.propagationFactory(
  ExtraFieldPropagation.newFactory(B3Propagation.FACTORY, "x-amzn-trace-id")
);</programlisting>
<tip>
<simpara>In Spring Cloud Sleuth all elements of the tracing builder <literal>Tracing.newBuilder()</literal>
are defined as beans. So if you want to pass a custom <literal>PropagationFactory</literal>, it&#8217;s enough
for you to create a bean of that type and we will set it in the <literal>Tracing</literal> bean.</simpara>
</tip>
<section xml:id="prefixed-fields">
<title>Prefixed fields</title>
<simpara>If they follow a common pattern, you can also prefix fields.
The following example shows how to propagate <literal>x-vcap-request-id</literal> the field as-is but send the <literal>country-code</literal> and <literal>user-id</literal> fields on the wire as <literal>x-baggage-country-code</literal> and <literal>x-baggage-user-id</literal>, respectively:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">Tracing.newBuilder().propagationFactory(
  ExtraFieldPropagation.newFactoryBuilder(B3Propagation.FACTORY)
                       .addField("x-vcap-request-id")
                       .addPrefixedFields("x-baggage-", Arrays.asList("country-code", "user-id"))
                       .build()
);</programlisting>
<simpara>Later, you can call the following code to affect the country code of the current trace context:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">ExtraFieldPropagation.set("x-country-code", "FO");
String countryCode = ExtraFieldPropagation.get("x-country-code");</programlisting>
<simpara>Alternatively, if you have a reference to a trace context, you can use it explicitly, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">ExtraFieldPropagation.set(span.context(), "x-country-code", "FO");
String countryCode = ExtraFieldPropagation.get(span.context(), "x-country-code");</programlisting>
<important>
<simpara>A difference from previous versions of Sleuth is that, with Brave, you must pass the list of baggage keys.
There are two properties to achieve this.
With the <literal>spring.sleuth.baggage-keys</literal>, you set keys that get prefixed with <literal>baggage-</literal> for HTTP calls and <literal>baggage_</literal> for messaging.
You can also use the <literal>spring.sleuth.propagation-keys</literal> property to pass a list of prefixed keys that are whitelisted without any prefix.
Notice that there&#8217;s no <literal>x-</literal> in front of the header keys.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>In order to automatically set the baggage values to Slf4j&#8217;s MDC, you have to set
the <literal>spring.sleuth.log.slf4j.whitelisted-mdc-keys</literal> property with a list of whitelisted
baggage and propagation keys. E.g. <literal>spring.sleuth.log.slf4j.whitelisted-mdc-keys=foo</literal> will set the value of the <literal>foo</literal> baggage into MDC.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>Remember that adding entries to MDC can drastically decrease the performance of your application!</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>If you want to add the baggage entries as tags, to make it possible to search for spans via the baggage entries, you can set the value of
<literal>spring.sleuth.propagation.tag.whitelisted-keys</literal> with a list of whitelisted baggage keys. To disable the feature you have to pass the <literal>spring.sleuth.propagation.tag.enabled=false</literal> property.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_extracting_a_propagated_context">
<title>Extracting a Propagated Context</title>
<simpara>The <literal>TraceContext.Extractor&lt;C&gt;</literal> reads trace identifiers and sampling status from an incoming request or message.
The carrier is usually a request object or headers.</simpara>
<simpara>This utility is used in standard instrumentation (such as <literal>HttpServerHandler</literal>) but can also be used for custom RPC or messaging code.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>TraceContextOrSamplingFlags</literal> is usually used only with <literal>Tracer.nextSpan(extracted)</literal>, unless you are
sharing span IDs between a client and a server.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_sharing_span_ids_between_client_and_server">
<title>Sharing span IDs between Client and Server</title>
<simpara>A normal instrumentation pattern is to create a span representing the server side of an RPC.
<literal>Extractor.extract</literal> might return a complete trace context when applied to an incoming client request.
<literal>Tracer.joinSpan</literal> attempts to continue this trace, using the same span ID if supported or creating a child span
if not. When the span ID is shared, the reported data includes a flag saying so.</simpara>

<simpara>Some propagation systems forward only the parent span ID, detected when <literal>Propagation.Factory.supportsJoin() == false</literal>.
In this case, a new span ID is always provisioned, and the incoming context determines the parent ID.</simpara>

<simpara>Note: Some span reporters do not support sharing span IDs.
For example, if you set <literal>Tracing.Builder.spanReporter(amazonXrayOrGoogleStackdrive)</literal>, you should disable join by setting <literal>Tracing.Builder.supportsJoin(false)</literal>.
Doing so forces a new child span on <literal>Tracer.joinSpan()</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_implementing_propagation">
<title>Implementing Propagation</title>
<simpara><literal>TraceContext.Extractor&lt;C&gt;</literal> is implemented by a <literal>Propagation.Factory</literal> plugin.
Internally, this code creates the union type, <literal>TraceContextOrSamplingFlags</literal>, with one of the following:
* <literal>TraceContext</literal> if trace and span IDs were present.
* <literal>TraceIdContext</literal> if a trace ID was present but span IDs were not present.
* <literal>SamplingFlags</literal> if no identifiers were present.</simpara>
<simpara>Some <literal>Propagation</literal> implementations carry extra data from the point of extraction (for example, reading incoming headers) to injection (for example, writing outgoing headers).
For example, it might carry a request ID.
When implementations have extra data, they handle it as follows:
* If a <literal>TraceContext</literal> were extracted, add the extra data as <literal>TraceContext.extra()</literal>.
* Otherwise, add it as <literal>TraceContextOrSamplingFlags.extra()</literal>, which <literal>Tracer.nextSpan</literal> handles.</simpara>

<title>Current Tracing Component</title>
<simpara>Brave supports a <quote>current tracing component</quote> concept, which should only be used when you have no other way to get a reference.
This was made for JDBC connections, as they often initialize prior to the tracing component.</simpara>
<simpara>The most recent tracing component instantiated is available through <literal>Tracing.current()</literal>.
You can also use <literal>Tracing.currentTracer()</literal> to get only the tracer.
If you use either of these methods, do not cache the result.
Instead, look them up each time you need them.</simpara>

<simpara>Brave supports a <quote>current span</quote> concept which represents the in-flight operation.
You can use <literal>Tracer.currentSpan()</literal> to add custom tags to a span and <literal>Tracer.nextSpan()</literal> to create a child of whatever is in-flight.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>In Sleuth, you can autowire the <literal>Tracer</literal> bean to retrieve the current span via
<literal>tracer.currentSpan()</literal> method. To retrieve the current context just call
<literal>tracer.currentSpan().context()</literal>. To get the current trace id as String

</important>
<section xml:id="_setting_a_span_in_scope_manually">
<title>Setting a span in scope manually</title>
<simpara>When writing new instrumentation, it is important to place a span you created in scope as the current span.
Not only does doing so let users access it with <literal>Tracer.currentSpan()</literal>, but it also allows customizations such as SLF4J MDC to see the current trace IDs.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>Tracer.withSpanInScope(Span)</literal> facilitates this and is most conveniently employed by using the try-with-resources idiom.
Whenever external code might be invoked (such as proceeding an interceptor or otherwise), place the span in scope, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowired Tracer tracer;

try (SpanInScope ws = tracer.withSpanInScope(span)) {
  return inboundRequest.invoke();
} finally { // note the scope is independent of the span
  span.finish();
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In edge cases, you may need to clear the current span temporarily (for example, launching a task that should not be associated with the current request). To do tso, pass null to <literal>withSpanInScope</literal>, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowired Tracer tracer;

<simpara>It is pretty rare to create separate classes for <literal>Runnable</literal> or <literal>Callable</literal>.
Typically, one creates an anonymous instance of those classes.
You cannot annotate such classes.
To overcome that limitation, if there is no <literal>@SpanName</literal> annotation present, we check whether the class has a custom implementation of the <literal>toString()</literal> method.</simpara>
<simpara>Running such code leads to creating a span named <literal>calculateTax</literal>, as shown in the following example:</simpara>

<title>Managing Spans with Annotations</title>
<simpara>You can manage spans with a variety of annotations.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_rationale">
<title>Rationale</title>
<simpara>There are a number of good reasons to manage spans with annotations, including:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>API-agnostic means to collaborate with a span. Use of annotations lets users add to a span with no library dependency on a span api.
Doing so lets Sleuth change its core API to create less impact to user code.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Reduced surface area for basic span operations. Without this feature, you must use the span api, which has lifecycle commands that could be used incorrectly.
By only exposing scope, tag, and log functionality, you can collaborate without accidentally breaking span lifecycle.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Collaboration with runtime generated code. With libraries such as Spring Data and Feign, the implementations of interfaces are generated at runtime.
Consequently, span wrapping of objects was tedious.
Now you can provide annotations over interfaces and the arguments of those interfaces.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>
<section xml:id="_creating_new_spans">
<title>Creating New Spans</title>
<simpara>If you do not want to create local spans manually, you can use the <literal>@NewSpan</literal> annotation.
Also, we provide the <literal>@SpanTag</literal> annotation to add tags in an automated fashion.</simpara>
<simpara>Now we can consider some examples of usage.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@NewSpan
void testMethod();</programlisting>
<simpara>Annotating the method without any parameter leads to creating a new span whose name equals the annotated method name.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@NewSpan("customNameOnTestMethod4")
void testMethod4();</programlisting>
<simpara>If you provide the value in the annotation (either directly or by setting the <literal>name</literal> parameter), the created span has the provided value as the name.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// method declaration
@NewSpan(name = "customNameOnTestMethod5")
void testMethod5(@SpanTag("testTag") String param);

// and method execution
this.testBean.testMethod5("test");</programlisting>
<simpara>You can combine both the name and a tag. Let&#8217;s focus on the latter.
In this case, the value of the annotated method&#8217;s parameter runtime value becomes the value of the tag.
In our sample, the tag key is <literal>testTag</literal>, and the tag value is <literal>test</literal>.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@NewSpan(name = "customNameOnTestMethod3")
@Override
public void testMethod3() {
}</programlisting>
<simpara>You can place the <literal>@NewSpan</literal> annotation on both the class and an interface.
If you override the interface&#8217;s method and provide a different value for the <literal>@NewSpan</literal> annotation, the most
concrete one wins (in this case <literal>customNameOnTestMethod3</literal> is set).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_continuing_spans">
<title>Continuing Spans</title>
<simpara>If you want to add tags and annotations to an existing span, you can use the <literal>@ContinueSpan</literal> annotation, as shown in the following example:</simpara>

@ContinueSpan(log = "testMethod11")
void testMethod11(@SpanTag("testTag11") String param);

// method execution
this.testBean.testMethod11("test");
this.testBean.testMethod13();</programlisting>
<simpara>(Note that, in contrast with the <literal>@NewSpan</literal> annotation ,you can also add logs with the <literal>log</literal> parameter.)</simpara>
<simpara>That way, the span gets continued and:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Log entries named <literal>testMethod11.before</literal> and <literal>testMethod11.after</literal> are created.</simpara>
</listitem>

<section xml:id="_custom_service_name">
<title>Custom service name</title>
<simpara>By default, Sleuth assumes that, when you send a span to Zipkin, you want the span&#8217;s service name to be equal to the value of the <literal>spring.application.name</literal> property.
That is not always the case, though.
There are situations in which you want to explicitly provide a different service name for all spans coming from your application.
To achieve that, you can pass the following property to your application to override that value (the example is for a service named <literal>myService</literal>):</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.zipkin.service.name: myService</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_customization_of_reported_spans">
<title>Customization of Reported Spans</title>
<simpara>Before reporting spans (for example, to Zipkin) you may want to modify that span in some way.
You can do so by using the <literal>FinishedSpanHandler</literal> interface.</simpara>
<simpara>In Sleuth, we generate spans with a fixed name.
Some users want to modify the name depending on values of tags.
You can implement the <literal>FinishedSpanHandler</literal> interface to alter that name.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows how to register two beans that implement <literal>FinishedSpanHandler</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
FinishedSpanHandler handlerOne() {
	return new FinishedSpanHandler() {
		@Override
		public boolean handle(TraceContext traceContext, MutableSpan span) {

			span.name(span.name() + " bar");
			return true; // keep this span

</important>
<simpara>To define the host that corresponds to a particular span, we need to resolve the host name and port.
The default approach is to take these values from server properties.
If those are not set, we try to retrieve the host name from the network interfaces.</simpara>
<simpara>If you have the discovery client enabled and prefer to retrieve the host address from the registered instance in a service registry, you have to set the <literal>spring.zipkin.locator.discovery.enabled</literal> property (it is applicable for both HTTP-based and Stream-based span reporting), as follows:</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_sending_spans_to_zipkin">
<title>Sending Spans to Zipkin</title>
<simpara>By default, if you add <literal>spring-cloud-starter-zipkin</literal> as a dependency to your project, when the span is closed, it is sent to Zipkin over HTTP.
The communication is asynchronous.
You can configure the URL by setting the <literal>spring.zipkin.baseUrl</literal> property, as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.zipkin.baseUrl: https://192.168.99.100:9411/</programlisting>
<simpara>If you want to find Zipkin through service discovery, you can pass the Zipkin&#8217;s service ID inside the URL, as shown in the following example for <literal>zipkinserver</literal> service ID:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.zipkin.baseUrl: http://zipkinserver/</programlisting>
<simpara>To disable this feature just set <literal>spring.zipkin.discoveryClientEnabled</literal> to `false.</simpara>
<simpara>When the Discovery Client feature is enabled, Sleuth uses
<literal>LoadBalancerClient</literal> to find the URL of the Zipkin Server. It means
that you can set up the load balancing configuration e.g. via Ribbon.</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">zipkinserver:

    ListOfServers: host1,host2</programlisting>
<simpara>If you have web, rabbit, or kafka together on the classpath, you might need to pick the means by which you would like to send spans to zipkin.
To do so, set <literal>web</literal>, <literal>rabbit</literal>, or <literal>kafka</literal> to the <literal>spring.zipkin.sender.type</literal> property.
The following example shows setting the sender type for <literal>web</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.zipkin.sender.type: web</programlisting>
<simpara>To customize the <literal>RestTemplate</literal> that sends spans to Zipkin via HTTP, you can register

<simpara>Since we want the span names to be precise, we use a <literal>TraceHandlerInterceptor</literal> that either wraps an existing <literal>HandlerInterceptor</literal> or is added directly to the list of existing <literal>HandlerInterceptors</literal>.
The <literal>TraceHandlerInterceptor</literal> adds a special request attribute to the given <literal>HttpServletRequest</literal>.
If the the <literal>TracingFilter</literal> does not see this attribute, it creates a <quote>fallback</quote> span, which is an additional span created on the server side so that the trace is presented properly in the UI.
If that happens, there is probably missing instrumentation.
In that case, please file an issue in Spring Cloud Sleuth.</simpara>

<simpara>Through <literal>TraceWebFilter</literal>, all sampled incoming requests result in creation of a Span.
That Span&#8217;s name is <literal>http:</literal> + the path to which the request was sent.
For example, if the request was sent to <literal>/this/that</literal>, the name is <literal>http:/this/that</literal>.
You can configure which URIs you would like to skip by using the <literal>spring.sleuth.web.skipPattern</literal> property.
If you have <literal>ManagementServerProperties</literal> on the classpath, its value of <literal>contextPath</literal> gets appended to the provided skip pattern.

<chapter xml:id="spring-cloud-consul-discovery">
<title>Service Discovery with Consul</title>
<simpara>Service Discovery is one of the key tenets of a microservice based architecture. Trying to hand configure each client or some form of convention can be very difficult to do and can be very brittle.  Consul provides Service Discovery services via an <link xl:href="https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/http.html">HTTP API</link> and <link xl:href="https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/dns.html">DNS</link>.  Spring Cloud Consul leverages the HTTP API for service registration and discovery.  This does not prevent non-Spring Cloud applications from leveraging the DNS interface.  Consul Agents servers are run in a <link xl:href="https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/architecture.html">cluster</link> that communicates via a <link xl:href="https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/gossip.html">gossip protocol</link> and uses the <link xl:href="https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/consensus.html">Raft consensus protocol</link>.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_registering_with_consul">
<title>Registering with Consul</title>
<simpara>When a client registers with Consul, it provides meta-data about itself such as host and port, id, name and tags.  An HTTP <link xl:href="https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/checks.html">Check</link> is created by default that Consul hits the <literal>/health</literal> endpoint every 10 seconds.  If the health check fails, the service instance is marked as critical.</simpara>
<simpara>Example Consul client:</simpara>

    }

}</programlisting>
<simpara>(i.e. utterly normal Spring Boot app).  If the Consul client is located somewhere other than <literal>localhost:8500</literal>, the configuration is required to locate the client. Example:</simpara>

<title>HTTP Health Check</title>
<simpara>The health check for a Consul instance defaults to "/health", which is the default locations of a useful endpoint in a Spring Boot Actuator application. You need to change these, even for an Actuator application if you use a non-default context path or servlet path (e.g. <literal>server.servletPath=/foo</literal>) or management endpoint path (e.g. <literal>management.server.servlet.context-path=/admin</literal>). The interval that Consul uses to check the health endpoint may also be configured.  "10s" and "1m" represent 10 seconds and 1 minute respectively.  Example:</simpara>
<formalpara>

<section xml:id="_making_the_consul_instance_id_unique">
<title>Making the Consul Instance ID Unique</title>
<simpara>By default a consul instance is registered with an ID that is equal to its Spring Application Context ID. By default, the Spring Application Context ID is <literal>${spring.application.name}:comma,separated,profiles:${server.port}</literal>. For most cases, this will allow multiple instances of one service to run on one machine.  If further uniqueness is required, Using Spring Cloud you can override this by providing a unique identifier in <literal>spring.cloud.consul.discovery.instanceId</literal>. For example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>spring:
  cloud:
    consul:
      discovery:
        instanceId: ${spring.application.name}:${vcap.application.instance_id:${spring.application.instance_id:${random.value}}}</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>With this metadata, and multiple service instances deployed on localhost, the random value will kick in there to make the instance unique. In Cloudfoundry the <literal>vcap.application.instance_id</literal> will be populated automatically in a Spring Boot application, so the random value will not be needed.</simpara>

<title>Distributed Configuration with Consul</title>
<simpara>Consul provides a <link xl:href="https://consul.io/docs/agent/http/kv.html">Key/Value Store</link> for storing configuration and other metadata.  Spring Cloud Consul Config is an alternative to the <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config">Config Server and Client</link>.  Configuration is loaded into the Spring Environment during the special "bootstrap" phase.  Configuration is stored in the <literal>/config</literal> folder by default.  Multiple <literal>PropertySource</literal> instances are created based on the application&#8217;s name and the active profiles that mimicks the Spring Cloud Config order of resolving properties.  For example, an application with the name "testApp" and with the "dev" profile will have the following property sources created:</simpara>
<screen>config/testApp,dev/
config/testApp/
config/application,dev/
config/application/</screen>
<simpara>The most specific property source is at the top, with the least specific at the bottom.  Properties in the <literal>config/application</literal> folder are applicable to all applications using consul for configuration.  Properties in the <literal>config/testApp</literal> folder are only available to the instances of the service named "testApp".</simpara>
<simpara>Configuration is currently read on startup of the application.

However, Zookeeper 3.4.x is also used in production.
Prior to Apache Curator 4.0, both versions of Zookeeper were supported via two versions of Apache Curator.
Starting with Curator 4.0 both versions of Zookeeper are supported via the same Curator libraries.</simpara>
<simpara>In case you are integrating with version 3.4 you need to change the Zookeeper dependency
that comes shipped with <literal>curator</literal>, and thus <literal>spring-cloud-zookeeper</literal>.

filtering on that metadata in the Ribbon <literal>ZookeeperServerList</literal>. The <literal>ZookeeperServerList</literal>
filters out all non-null instance statuses that do not equal <literal>UP</literal>. If the instance status

<title>Using the Zookeeper Dependencies</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Zookeeper gives you a possibility to provide dependencies of your application
as properties. As dependencies, you can understand other applications that are registered
in Zookeeper and which you would like to call through
<link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-cloud-netflix.adoc#spring-cloud-feign">Feign</link>

<simpara>You can also use the Zookeeper Dependency Watchers functionality to control and monitor
the state of your dependencies.</simpara>

<section xml:id="spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependencies-activating">
<title>Activating Zookeeper Dependencies</title>
<simpara>Including a dependency on
<literal>org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-zookeeper-discovery</literal> enables
autoconfiguration that sets up Spring Cloud Zookeeper Dependencies. Even if you provide
the dependencies in your properties, you can turn off the dependencies. To do so, set the
<literal>spring.cloud.zookeeper.dependency.enabled</literal> property to false (it defaults to <literal>true</literal>).</simpara>

<section xml:id="spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependencies-setting-up">
<title>Setting up Zookeeper Dependencies</title>
<simpara>Consider the following example of dependency representation:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.application.name: yourServiceName
spring.cloud.zookeeper:
  dependencies:

      version: v1
      required: true</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>The next few sections go through each part of the dependency one by one. The root property
name is <literal>spring.cloud.zookeeper.dependencies</literal>.</simpara>
<section xml:id="spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependencies-setting-up-aliases">
<title>Aliases</title>
<simpara>Below the root property you have to represent each dependency as an alias. This is due to
the constraints of Ribbon, which requires that the application ID be placed in the URL.
Consequently, you cannot pass any complex path, suchas  <literal>/myApp/myRoute/name</literal>). The alias
is the name you use instead of the <literal>serviceId</literal> for <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal>, <literal>Feign</literal>, or
<literal>RestTemplate</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>In the previous examples, the aliases are <literal>newsletter</literal> and <literal>mailing</literal>. The following
example shows Feign usage with a <literal>newsletter</literal> alias:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@FeignClient("newsletter")
public interface NewsletterService {
        @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value = "/newsletter")
        String getNewsletters();
}</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_path">
<title>Path</title>
<simpara>The path is represented by the <literal>path</literal> YAML property and is the path under which the
dependency is registered under Zookeeper. As described in the
<link linkend="spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependencies-setting-up-aliases">previous section</link>, Ribbon
operates on URLs. As a result, this path is not compliant with its requirement.
That is why Spring Cloud Zookeeper maps the alias to the proper path.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_load_balancer_type">
<title>Load Balancer Type</title>
<simpara>The load balancer type is represented by <literal>loadBalancerType</literal> YAML property.</simpara>
<simpara>If you know what kind of load-balancing strategy has to be applied when calling this
particular dependency, you can provide it in the YAML file, and it is automatically
applied. You can choose one of the following load balancing strategies:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>STICKY: Once chosen, the instance is always called.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>RANDOM: Picks an instance randomly.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>ROUND_ROBIN: Iterates over instances over and over again.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>
<section xml:id="_content_type_template_and_version">
<title><literal>Content-Type</literal> Template and Version</title>
<simpara>The <literal>Content-Type</literal> template and version are represented by the <literal>contentTypeTemplate</literal> and
<literal>version</literal> YAML properties.</simpara>
<simpara>If you version your API in the <literal>Content-Type</literal> header, you do not want to add this header
to each of your requests. Also, if you want to call a new version of the API, you do not
want to roam around your code to bump up the API version. That is why you can provide a
<literal>contentTypeTemplate</literal> with a special <literal>$version</literal> placeholder. That placeholder will be filled by the value of the
<literal>version</literal> YAML property. Consider the following example of a <literal>contentTypeTemplate</literal>:</simpara>
<screen>application/vnd.newsletter.$version+json</screen>
<simpara>Further consider the following <literal>version</literal>:</simpara>
<screen>v1</screen>
<simpara>The combination of <literal>contentTypeTemplate</literal> and version results in the creation of a
<literal>Content-Type</literal> header for each request, as follows:</simpara>
<screen>application/vnd.newsletter.v1+json</screen>
</section>
<section xml:id="_default_headers">
<title>Default Headers</title>
<simpara>Default headers are represented by the <literal>headers</literal> map in YAML.</simpara>
<simpara>Sometimes, each call to a dependency requires setting up of some default headers. To not
do that in code, you can set them up in the YAML file, as shown in the following example
<literal>headers</literal> section:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yml" linenumbering="unnumbered">headers:
    Accept:
        - text/html
        - application/xhtml+xml
    Cache-Control:
        - no-cache</programlisting>
<simpara>That <literal>headers</literal> section results in adding the <literal>Accept</literal> and <literal>Cache-Control</literal> headers with
appropriate list of values in your HTTP request.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_required_dependencies">
<title>Required Dependencies</title>
<simpara>Required dependencies are represented by <literal>required</literal> property in YAML.</simpara>
<simpara>If one of your dependencies is required to be up when your application boots, you can set
the <literal>required: true</literal> property in the YAML file.</simpara>
<simpara>If your application cannot localize the required dependency during boot time, it throws an
exception, and the Spring Context fails to set up. In other words, your application cannot
start if the required dependency is not registered in Zookeeper.</simpara>
<simpara>You can read more about Spring Cloud Zookeeper Presence Checker
<link linkend="spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependency-watcher-presence-checker">later in this document</link>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_stubs">
<title>Stubs</title>
<simpara>You can provide a colon-separated path to the JAR containing stubs of the dependency, as
shown in the following example:</simpara>
<simpara><literal>stubs: org.springframework:myApp:stubs</literal></simpara>
<simpara>where:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>org.springframework</literal> is the <literal>groupId</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>myApp</literal> is the <literal>artifactId</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>stubs</literal> is the classifier. (Note that <literal>stubs</literal> is the default value.)</simpara>
</listitem>

<chapter xml:id="spring-cloud-zookeeper-config">
<title>Distributed Configuration with Zookeeper</title>
<simpara>Zookeeper provides a
<link xl:href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperOver.html#sc_dataModelNameSpace">hierarchical namespace</link>
that lets clients store arbitrary data, such as configuration data. Spring Cloud Zookeeper
Config is an alternative to the
<link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config">Config Server and Client</link>.
Configuration is loaded into the Spring Environment during the special <quote>bootstrap</quote>
phase. Configuration is stored in the <literal>/config</literal> namespace by default. Multiple
<literal>PropertySource</literal> instances are created, based on the application&#8217;s name and the active
profiles, to mimic the Spring Cloud Config order of resolving properties. For example, an
application with a name of <literal>testApp</literal> and with the <literal>dev</literal> profile has the following property
sources created for it:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>config/testApp,dev</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>config/testApp</literal></simpara>

<simpara>The most specific property source is at the top, with the least specific at the bottom.
Properties in the <literal>config/application</literal> namespace apply to all applications that use
zookeeper for configuration. Properties in the <literal>config/testApp</literal> namespace are available
only to the instances of the service named <literal>testApp</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Configuration is currently read on startup of the application. Sending a HTTP <literal>POST</literal>

}</programlisting>
<simpara>The creation of this bean must occur during the boostrapping phase. You can register
configuration classes to run during this phase by annotating them with
<literal>@BootstrapConfiguration</literal> and including them in a comma-separated list that you set as the
value of the <literal>org.springframework.cloud.bootstrap.BootstrapConfiguration</literal> property in the

<simpara>Spring Cloud Security offers a set of primitives for building secure
applications and services with minimum fuss. A declarative model which
can be heavily configured externally (or centrally) lends itself to
the implementation of large systems of co-operating, remote components,
usually with a central indentity management service. It is also extremely
easy to use in a service platform like Cloud Foundry. Building on
Spring Boot and Spring Security OAuth2 we can quickly create systems that
implement common patterns like single sign on, token relay and token
exchange.</simpara>

<simpara>run the app above and it will redirect to github for authorization. If
you are already signed into github you won&#8217;t even notice that it has
authenticated.  These credentials will only work if your app is
running on port 8080.</simpara>
<simpara>To limit the scope that the client asks for when it obtains an access token
you can set <literal>security.oauth2.client.scope</literal> (comma separated or an array in YAML). By
default the scope is empty and it is up to to Authorization Server to
decide what the defaults should be, usually depending on the settings in
the client registration that it holds.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The examples above are all Groovy scripts. If you want to write the
same code in Java (or Groovy) you need to add Spring Security OAuth2
to the classpath (e.g. see the

<note>
<simpara>Spring Boot (1.4.1) does not create an

correct header.</simpara>
<simpara>How does it work? The <literal>@EnableOAuth2Sso</literal> annotation pulls in
<literal>spring-cloud-starter-security</literal> (which you could do manually in a

<simpara>Spring Boot does not create an <literal>OAuth2RestOperations</literal> automatically which is needed for <literal>refresh_token</literal>. In that case you need to create your own

<title>Resource Server Token Relay</title>
<simpara>If your app has <literal>@EnableResourceServer</literal> you might want to relay the
incoming token downstream to other services. If you use a
<literal>RestTemplate</literal> to contact the downstream services then this is just a
matter of how to create the template with the right context.</simpara>
<simpara>If your service uses <literal>UserInfoTokenServices</literal> to authenticate incoming
tokens (i.e. it is using the <literal>security.oauth2.user-info-uri</literal>
configuration), then you can simply create an <literal>OAuth2RestTemplate</literal>
using an autowired <literal>OAuth2ClientContext</literal> (it will be populated by the
authentication process before it hits the backend code). Equivalently
(with Spring Boot 1.4), you could inject a
<literal>UserInfoRestTemplateFactory</literal> and grab its <literal>OAuth2RestTemplate</literal> in
your configuration. For example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>MyConfiguration.java</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public OAuth2RestTemplate restTemplate(UserInfoRestTemplateFactory factory) {
    return factory.getUserInfoRestTemplate();
}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>This rest template will then have the same <literal>OAuth2ClientContext</literal>
(request-scoped) that is used by the authentication filter, so you can
use it to send requests with the same access token.</simpara>
<simpara>If your app is not using <literal>UserInfoTokenServices</literal> but is still a client
(i.e. it declares <literal>@EnableOAuth2Client</literal> or <literal>@EnableOAuth2Sso</literal>), then
with Spring Security Cloud any <literal>OAuth2RestOperations</literal> that the user
creates from an <literal>@Autowired</literal> <literal>OAuth2Context</literal> will also forward
tokens. This feature is implemented by default as an MVC handler
interceptor, so it only works in Spring MVC. If you are not using MVC
you could use a custom filter or AOP interceptor wrapping an
<literal>AccessTokenContextRelay</literal> to provide the same feature.</simpara>
<simpara>Here&#8217;s a basic
example showing the use of an autowired rest template created
elsewhere ("foo.com" is a Resource Server accepting the same tokens as
the surrounding app):</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>MyController.java</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowired
private OAuth2RestOperations restTemplate;

@RequestMapping("/relay")
public String relay() {
    ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; response =
      restTemplate.getForEntity("https://foo.com/bar", String.class);
    return "Success! (" + response.getBody() + ")";
}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>If you don&#8217;t want to forward tokens (and that is a valid
choice, since you might want to act as yourself, rather than the
client that sent you the token), then you only need to create your own
<literal>OAuth2Context</literal> instead of autowiring the default one.</simpara>
<simpara>Feign clients will also pick up an interceptor that uses the
<literal>OAuth2ClientContext</literal> if it is available, so they should also do a
token relay anywhere where a <literal>RestTemplate</literal> would.</simpara>

<section xml:id="spring-cloud-contract-verifier-intro-three-second-tour-producer">
<title>On the Producer Side</title>
<simpara>To start working with Spring Cloud Contract, add files with <literal>REST/</literal> messaging contracts
expressed in either Groovy DSL or YAML to the contracts directory, which is set by the
<literal>contractsDslDir</literal> property. By default, it is <literal>$rootDir/src/test/resources/contracts</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Then add the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier dependency and plugin to your build file, as
shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>The following listing shows how to add the plugin, which should go in the build/plugins
portion of the file:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;plugin&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;version&gt;${spring-cloud-contract.version}&lt;/version&gt;
	&lt;extensions&gt;true&lt;/extensions&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Running <literal>./mvnw clean install</literal> automatically generates tests that verify the application
compliance with the added contracts. By default, the tests get generated under
<literal>org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.tests.</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>As the implementation of the functionalities described by the contracts is not yet
present, the tests fail.</simpara>
<simpara>To make them pass, you must add the correct implementation of either handling HTTP
requests or messages. Also, you must add a correct base test class for auto-generated
tests to the project. This class is extended by all the auto-generated tests, and it
should contain all the setup necessary to run them (for example <literal>RestAssuredMockMvc</literal>
controller setup or messaging test setup).</simpara>
<simpara>Once the implementation and the test base class are in place, the tests pass, and both the
application and the stub artifacts are built and installed in the local Maven repository.
The changes can now be merged, and both the application and the stub artifacts may be
published in an online repository.</simpara>

WireMock instance or messaging route that simulates the actual service.</simpara>
<simpara>To do so, add the dependency to <literal>Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner</literal>, as shown in the
following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;

	&lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>You can get the Producer-side stubs installed in your Maven repository in either of two
ways:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>By checking out the Producer side repository and adding contracts and generating the stubs
by running the following commands:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ cd local-http-server-repo
$ ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests</programlisting>
<tip>
<simpara>The tests are being skipped because the Producer-side contract implementation is not
in place yet, so the automatically-generated contract tests fail.</simpara>
</tip>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>By getting already-existing producer service stubs from a remote repository. To do so,
pass the stub artifact IDs and artifact repository URL as <literal>Spring Cloud Contract
Stub Runner</literal> properties, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">stubrunner:
  ids: 'com.example:http-server-dsl:+:stubs:8080'
  repositoryRoot: https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot</programlisting>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Now you can annotate your test class with <literal>@AutoConfigureStubRunner</literal>. In the annotation,
provide the <literal>group-id</literal> and <literal>artifact-id</literal> values for <literal>Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner</literal> to
run the collaborators' stubs for you, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)

<section xml:id="spring-cloud-contract-verifier-intro-three-minute-tour-producer">
<title>On the Producer Side</title>
<simpara>To start working with <literal>Spring Cloud Contract</literal>, add files with <literal>REST/</literal> messaging contracts
expressed in either Groovy DSL or YAML to the contracts directory, which is set by the
<literal>contractsDslDir</literal> property. By default, it is <literal>$rootDir/src/test/resources/contracts</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>For the HTTP stubs, a contract defines what kind of response should be returned for a
given request (taking into account the HTTP methods, URLs, headers, status codes, and so
on). The following example shows how an HTTP stub contract in Groovy DSL:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">package contracts

org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
	request {
		method 'PUT'
		url '/fraudcheck'
		body([
			   "client.id": $(regex('[0-9]{10}')),
			   loanAmount: 99999
		])
		headers {
			contentType('application/json')
		}
	}
	response {
		status OK()
		body([
			   fraudCheckStatus: "FRAUD",
			   "rejection.reason": "Amount too high"
		])
		headers {
			contentType('application/json')
		}
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The same contract expressed in YAML would look like the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">request:
  method: PUT
  url: /fraudcheck
  body:
    "client.id": 1234567890
    loanAmount: 99999
  headers:
    Content-Type: application/json
  matchers:
    body:
      - path: $.['client.id']
        type: by_regex
        value: "[0-9]{10}"
response:
  status: 200
  body:
    fraudCheckStatus: "FRAUD"
    "rejection.reason": "Amount too high"
  headers:
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8</programlisting>
<simpara>In the case of messaging, you can define:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>The input and the output messages can be defined (taking into account from and where it
was sent, the message body, and the header).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The methods that should be called after the message is received.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The methods that, when called, should trigger a message.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The following example shows a Camel messaging contract expressed in Groovy DSL:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">			def contractDsl = Contract.make {
				label 'some_label'
				input {
					messageFrom('jms:delete')
					messageBody([
							bookName: 'foo'
					])
					messageHeaders {
						header('sample', 'header')
					}
					assertThat('bookWasDeleted()')
				}
			}</programlisting>
<simpara>The following example shows the same contract expressed in YAML:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yml" linenumbering="unnumbered">label: some_label
input:
  messageFrom: jms:delete
  messageBody:
    bookName: 'foo'
  messageHeaders:
    sample: header
  assertThat: bookWasDeleted()</programlisting>
<simpara>Then you can add Spring Cloud Contract Verifier dependency and plugin to your build file,
as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>The following listing shows how to add the plugin, which should go in the build/plugins
portion of the file:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;plugin&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;version&gt;${spring-cloud-contract.version}&lt;/version&gt;
	&lt;extensions&gt;true&lt;/extensions&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Running <literal>./mvnw clean install</literal> automatically generates tests that verify the application
compliance with the added contracts. By default, the generated tests are under
<literal>org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.tests.</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows a sample auto-generated test for an HTTP contract:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Test
public void validate_shouldMarkClientAsFraud() throws Exception {
    // given:
        MockMvcRequestSpecification request = given()
                .header("Content-Type", "application/vnd.fraud.v1+json")
                .body("{\"client.id\":\"1234567890\",\"loanAmount\":99999}");

    // when:
        ResponseOptions response = given().spec(request)
                .put("/fraudcheck");

    // then:
        assertThat(response.statusCode()).isEqualTo(200);
        assertThat(response.header("Content-Type")).matches("application/vnd.fraud.v1.json.*");
    // and:
        DocumentContext parsedJson = JsonPath.parse(response.getBody().asString());
        assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("['fraudCheckStatus']").matches("[A-Z]{5}");
        assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("['rejection.reason']").isEqualTo("Amount too high");
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The preceding example uses Spring&#8217;s <literal>MockMvc</literal> to run the tests. This is the default test
mode for HTTP contracts. However, JAX-RS client and explicit HTTP invocations can also be
used. (To do so, change the <literal>testMode</literal> property of the plugin to <literal>JAX-RS</literal> or <literal>EXPLICIT</literal>,
respectively.)</simpara>
<simpara>Since 2.1.0, it is also possible to use <literal>RestAssuredWebTestClient`with Spring&#8217;s reactive `WebTestClient</literal>
run under the hood. This is particularly recommended while working with Reactive, <literal>Web-Flux</literal>-based applications.
In order to use <literal>WebTestClient</literal> set <literal>testMode</literal> to <literal>WEBTESTCLIENT</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Here is an example of a test generated in <literal>WEBTESTCLIENT</literal> test mode:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">[source,java,indent=0]</literallayout>
<screen>@Test
	public void validate_shouldRejectABeerIfTooYoung() throws Exception {
		// given:
			WebTestClientRequestSpecification request = given()
					.header("Content-Type", "application/json")
					.body("{\"age\":10}");

		// when:
			WebTestClientResponse response = given().spec(request)
					.post("/check");

		// then:
			assertThat(response.statusCode()).isEqualTo(200);
			assertThat(response.header("Content-Type")).matches("application/json.*");
		// and:
			DocumentContext parsedJson = JsonPath.parse(response.getBody().asString());
			assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("['status']").isEqualTo("NOT_OK");
	}</screen>
<simpara>Apart from the default JUnit 4, you can instead use JUnit 5 or Spock tests, by setting the plugin
<literal>testFramework</literal> property to either <literal>JUNIT5</literal> or <literal>Spock</literal>.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>You can now also generate WireMock scenarios based on the contracts, by including an
order number followed by an underscore at the beginning of the contract file names.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>The following example shows an auto-generated test in Spock for a messaging stub contract:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">[source,groovy,indent=0]</literallayout>
<screen>given:
	 ContractVerifierMessage inputMessage = contractVerifierMessaging.create(
		\'\'\'{"bookName":"foo"}\'\'\',
		['sample': 'header']
	)

when:
	 contractVerifierMessaging.send(inputMessage, 'jms:delete')

then:
	 noExceptionThrown()
	 bookWasDeleted()</screen>
<simpara>As the implementation of the functionalities described by the contracts is not yet
present, the tests fail.</simpara>
<simpara>To make them pass, you must add the correct implementation of handling either HTTP
requests or messages. Also, you must add a correct base test class for auto-generated
tests to the project. This class is extended by all the auto-generated tests and should
contain all the setup necessary to run them (for example, <literal>RestAssuredMockMvc</literal> controller
setup or messaging test setup).</simpara>
<simpara>Once the implementation and the test base class are in place, the tests pass, and both the
application and the stub artifacts are built and installed in the local Maven repository.
Information about installing the stubs jar to the local repository appears in the logs, as
shown in the following example:</simpara>

<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Docker Project</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>In order to enable working with contracts while creating applications in non-JVM
technologies, the <literal>springcloud/spring-cloud-contract</literal> Docker image has been created. It
contains a project that automatically generates tests for HTTP contracts and executes them
in  <literal>EXPLICIT</literal> test mode. Then, if the tests pass, it generates Wiremock stubs and,
optionally, publishes them to an artifact manager. In order to use the image, you can
mount the contracts into the <literal>/contracts</literal> directory and set a few environment variables.</simpara>

<title>Step-by-step Guide to Consumer Driven Contracts (CDC)</title>
<simpara>Consider an example of Fraud Detection and the Loan Issuance process. The business
scenario is such that we want to issue loans to people but do not want them to steal from
us. The current implementation of our system grants loans to everybody.</simpara>
<simpara>Assume that <literal>Loan Issuance</literal> is a client to the <literal>Fraud Detection</literal> server. In the current
sprint, we must develop a new feature: if a client wants to borrow too much money, then
we mark the client as a fraud.</simpara>
<simpara>Technical remark - Fraud Detection has an <literal>artifact-id</literal> of <literal>http-server</literal>, while Loan
Issuance has an artifact-id of <literal>http-client</literal>, and both have a <literal>group-id</literal> of <literal>com.example</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Social remark - both client and server development teams need to communicate directly and
discuss changes while going through the process. CDC is all about communication.</simpara>
<simpara>The <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/tree/2.1.x/samples/standalone/dsl/http-server">server
side code is available here</link> and <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/tree/2.1.x/samples/standalone/dsl/http-client">the
client code here</link>.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>In this case, the producer owns the contracts. Physically, all the contract are
in the producer&#8217;s repository.</simpara>

<simpara>Assume that you have written a test of your new feature. If a loan application for a big
amount is received, the system should reject that loan application with some description.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Write the missing implementation.</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>At some point in time, you need to send a request to the Fraud Detection service. Assume
that you need to send the request containing the ID of the client and the amount the
client wants to borrow. You want to send it to the <literal>/fraudcheck</literal> url via the <literal>PUT</literal> method.</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">ResponseEntity&lt;FraudServiceResponse&gt; response = restTemplate.exchange(

<simpara>For simplicity, the port of the Fraud Detection service is set to <literal>8080</literal>, and the
application runs on <literal>8090</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>If you start the test at this point, it breaks, because no service currently runs on port
<literal>8080</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Clone the Fraud Detection service repository locally.</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>You can start by playing around with the server side contract. To do so, you must first
clone it.</simpara>

<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Define the contract locally in the repo of Fraud Detection service.</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>As a consumer, you need to define what exactly you want to achieve. You need to formulate
your expectations. To do so, write the following contract:</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>Place the contract under <literal>src/test/resources/contracts/fraud</literal> folder. The <literal>fraud</literal> folder
is important because the producer&#8217;s test base class name references that folder.</simpara>

<simpara>The YML contract is quite straight-forward. However when you take a look at the Contract
written using a statically typed Groovy DSL - you might wonder what the
<literal>value(client(&#8230;&#8203;), server(&#8230;&#8203;))</literal> parts are. By using this notation, Spring Cloud
Contract lets you define parts of a JSON block, a URL, etc., which are dynamic. In case
of an identifier or a timestamp, you need not hardcode a value. You want to allow some
different ranges of values. To enable ranges of values, you can set regular expressions
matching those values for the consumer side. You can provide the body by means of either
a map notation or String with interpolations.
Consult the <xref linkend="contract-dsl"/> section for more information. We highly recommend using the map notation!</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>You must understand the map notation in order to set up contracts. Please read the
<link xl:href="https://groovy-lang.org/json.html">Groovy docs regarding JSON</link>.</simpara>

<simpara>The previously shown contract is an agreement between two sides that:</simpara>

<simpara>Once you are ready to check the API in practice in the integration tests, you need to

<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Add the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier plugin.</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>We can add either a Maven or a Gradle plugin. In this example, you see how to add Maven.
First, add the <literal>Spring Cloud Contract</literal> BOM.</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependencyManagement&gt;

		&lt;dependency&gt;
			&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;

			&lt;version&gt;${spring-cloud-release.version}&lt;/version&gt;
			&lt;type&gt;pom&lt;/type&gt;
			&lt;scope&gt;import&lt;/scope&gt;
		&lt;/dependency&gt;
	&lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Next, add the <literal>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier</literal> Maven plugin</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;plugin&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;

&lt;/plugin&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Since the plugin was added, you get the <literal>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier</literal> features which,
from the provided contracts:</simpara>

<simpara>You do not want to generate tests since you, as the consumer, want only to play with the

<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier&lt;/artifactId&gt;

&lt;/plugin&gt;</programlisting>
<important>
<simpara>This example uses "convention based" naming by setting the
<literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal> property. Doing so means that the two last packages combine to
make the name of the base test class. In our case, the contracts were placed under
<literal>src/test/resources/contracts/fraud</literal>. Since you do not have two packages starting from
the <literal>contracts</literal> folder, pick only one, which should be <literal>fraud</literal>. Add the <literal>Base</literal> suffix and
capitalize <literal>fraud</literal>. That gives you the <literal>FraudBase</literal> test class name.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>All the generated tests extend that class. Over there, you can set up your Spring Context
or whatever is necessary. In this case, use <link xl:href="https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured">Rest Assured MVC</link> to

<simpara>This error occurs because you have a new contract from which a test was generated and it

like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Test

<simpara>If you used the Groovy DSL, you can see, all the <literal>producer()</literal> parts of the Contract that were present in the
<literal>value(consumer(&#8230;&#8203;), producer(&#8230;&#8203;))</literal> blocks got injected into the test.
In case of using YAML, the same applied for the <literal>matchers</literal> sections of the <literal>response</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Note that, on the producer side, you are also doing TDD. The expectations are expressed
in the form of a test. This test sends a request to our own application with the URL,
headers, and body defined in the contract. It also is expecting precisely defined values
in the response. In other words, you have the <literal>red</literal> part of <literal>red</literal>, <literal>green</literal>, and
<literal>refactor</literal>. It is time to convert the <literal>red</literal> into the <literal>green</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Write the missing implementation.</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>Because you know the expected input and expected output, you can write the missing
implementation:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RequestMapping(value = "/fraudcheck", method = PUT)
public FraudCheckResult fraudCheck(@RequestBody FraudCheck fraudCheck) {
if (amountGreaterThanThreshold(fraudCheck)) {
	return new FraudCheckResult(FraudCheckStatus.FRAUD, AMOUNT_TOO_HIGH);
}
return new FraudCheckResult(FraudCheckStatus.OK, NO_REASON);
}</programlisting>
<simpara>When you execute <literal>./mvnw clean install</literal> again, the tests pass. Since the <literal>Spring Cloud

actually run those tests from your IDE.</simpara>

<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ git checkout master
$ git merge --no-ff contract-change-pr

<simpara>Your CI might run something like <literal>./mvnw clean deploy</literal>, which would publish both the

<title>I don&#8217;t want to write a contract in Groovy!</title>
<simpara>No problem. You can write a contract in YAML!</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_what_is_this_valueconsumer_producer">
<title>What is this value(consumer(), producer()) ?</title>
<simpara>One of the biggest challenges related to stubs is their reusability. Only if they can be vastly used, will they serve their purpose.
What typically makes that difficult are the hard-coded values of request / response elements. For example dates or ids.
Imagine the following JSON request</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
    "time" : "2016-10-10 20:10:15",
    "id" : "9febab1c-6f36-4a0b-88d6-3b6a6d81cd4a",
    "body" : "foo"
}</programlisting>
<simpara>and JSON response</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
    "time" : "2016-10-10 21:10:15",
    "id" : "c4231e1f-3ca9-48d3-b7e7-567d55f0d051",
    "body" : "bar"
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Imagine the pain required to set proper value of the <literal>time</literal> field (let&#8217;s assume that this content is generated by the
database) by changing the clock in the system or providing stub implementations of data providers. The same is related
to the field called <literal>id</literal>. Will you create a stubbed implementation of UUID generator? Makes little sense&#8230;&#8203;</simpara>
<simpara>So as a consumer you would like to send a request that matches any form of a time or any UUID. That way your system
will work as usual - will generate data and you won&#8217;t have to stub anything out. Let&#8217;s assume that in case of the aforementioned
JSON the most important part is the <literal>body</literal> field. You can focus on that and provide matching for other fields. In other words
you would like the stub to work like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
    "time" : "SOMETHING THAT MATCHES TIME",
    "id" : "SOMETHING THAT MATCHES UUID",
    "body" : "foo"
}</programlisting>
<simpara>As far as the response goes as a consumer you need a concrete value that you can operate on. So such a JSON is valid</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
    "time" : "2016-10-10 21:10:15",
    "id" : "c4231e1f-3ca9-48d3-b7e7-567d55f0d051",
    "body" : "bar"
}</programlisting>
<simpara>As you could see in the previous sections we generate tests from contracts. So from the producer&#8217;s side the situation looks
much different. We&#8217;re parsing the provided contract and in the test we want to send a real request to your endpoints.
So for the case of a producer for the request we can&#8217;t have any sort of matching. We need concrete values that the
producer&#8217;s backend can work on. Such a JSON would be a valid one:</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
    "time" : "2016-10-10 20:10:15",
    "id" : "9febab1c-6f36-4a0b-88d6-3b6a6d81cd4a",
    "body" : "foo"
}</programlisting>
<simpara>On the other hand from the point of view of the validity of the contract the response doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to
contain concrete values of <literal>time</literal> or <literal>id</literal>. Let&#8217;s say that you generate those on the producer side - again, you&#8217;d
have to do a lot of stubbing to ensure that you always return the same values. That&#8217;s why from the producer&#8217;s side
what you might want is the following response:</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
    "time" : "SOMETHING THAT MATCHES TIME",
    "id" : "SOMETHING THAT MATCHES UUID",
    "body" : "bar"
}</programlisting>
<simpara>How can you then provide one time a matcher for the consumer and a concrete value for the producer and vice versa?
In Spring Cloud Contract we&#8217;re allowing you to provide a <emphasis role="strong">dynamic value</emphasis>. That means that it can differ for both
sides of the communication. You can pass the values:</simpara>
<simpara>Either via the <literal>value</literal> method</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">value(consumer(...), producer(...))
value(stub(...), test(...))
value(client(...), server(...))</programlisting>
<simpara>or using the <literal>$()</literal> method</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">$(consumer(...), producer(...))
$(stub(...), test(...))
$(client(...), server(...))</programlisting>
<simpara>You can read more about this in the <xref linkend="contract-dsl"/> section.</simpara>
<simpara>Calling <literal>value()</literal> or <literal>$()</literal> tells Spring Cloud Contract that you will be passing a dynamic value.
Inside the <literal>consumer()</literal> method you pass the value that should be used on the consumer side (in the generated stub).
Inside the <literal>producer()</literal> method you pass the value that should be used on the producer side (in the generated test).</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>If on one side you have passed the regular expression and you haven&#8217;t passed the other, then the
other side will get auto-generated.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>Most often you will use that method together with the <literal>regex</literal> helper method. E.g. <literal>consumer(regex('[0-9]{10}'))</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To sum it up the contract for the aforementioned scenario would look more or less like this (the regular expression
for time and UUID are simplified and most likely invalid but we want to keep things very simple in this example):</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
				request {
					method 'GET'
					url '/someUrl'
					body([
					    time : value(consumer(regex('[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2} [0-2][0-9]-[0-5][0-9]-[0-5][0-9]')),
					    id: value(consumer(regex('[0-9a-zA-z]{8}-[0-9a-zA-z]{4}-[0-9a-zA-z]{4}-[0-9a-zA-z]{12}'))
					    body: "foo"
					])
				}
			response {
				status OK()
				body([
					    time : value(producer(regex('[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2} [0-2][0-9]-[0-5][0-9]-[0-5][0-9]')),
					    id: value([producer(regex('[0-9a-zA-z]{8}-[0-9a-zA-z]{4}-[0-9a-zA-z]{4}-[0-9a-zA-z]{12}'))
					    body: "bar"
					])
			}
}</programlisting>

properly structure the request / response bodies.</simpara>

<title>API Versioning</title>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s try to answer a question what versioning really means. If you&#8217;re referring to the API version then there are
different approaches.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>use Hypermedia, links and do not version your API by any means</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>pass versions through headers / urls</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>I will not try to answer a question which approach is better. Whatever suits your needs and allows you to generate
business value should be picked.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s assume that you do version your API. In that case you should provide as many contracts as many versions you support.
You can create a subfolder for every version or append it to the contract name - whatever suits you more.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_jar_versioning">
<title>JAR versioning</title>
<simpara>If by versioning you mean the version of the JAR that contains the stubs then there are essentially two main approaches.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s assume that you&#8217;re doing Continuous Delivery / Deployment which means that you&#8217;re generating a new version of
the jar each time you go through the pipeline and that jar can go to production at any time. For example your jar version
looks like this (it got built on the 20.10.2016 at 20:15:21) :</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">1.0.0.20161020-201521-RELEASE</programlisting>
<simpara>In that case your generated stub jar will look like this.</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">1.0.0.20161020-201521-RELEASE-stubs.jar</programlisting>
<simpara>In this case you should inside your <literal>application.yml</literal> or <literal>@AutoConfigureStubRunner</literal> when referencing stubs provide the
 latest version of the stubs. You can do that by passing the <literal>+</literal> sign. Example</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:http-server-dsl:+:stubs:8080"})</programlisting>
<simpara>If the versioning however is fixed (e.g. <literal>1.0.4.RELEASE</literal> or <literal>2.1.1</literal>) then you have to set the concrete value of the jar
version. Example for 2.1.1.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:http-server-dsl:2.1.1:stubs:8080"})</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_dev_or_prod_stubs">
<title>Dev or prod stubs</title>
<simpara>You can manipulate the classifier to run the tests against current development version of the stubs of other services
 or the ones that were deployed to production. If you alter your build to deploy the stubs with the <literal>prod-stubs</literal> classifier
 once you reach production deployment then you can run tests in one case with dev stubs and one with prod stubs.</simpara>
<simpara>Example of tests using development version of stubs</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:http-server-dsl:+:stubs:8080"})</programlisting>
<simpara>Example of tests using production version of stubs</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:http-server-dsl:+:prod-stubs:8080"})</programlisting>
<simpara>You can pass those values also via properties from your deployment pipeline.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="_common_repo_with_contracts">
<title>Common repo with contracts</title>
<simpara>Another way of storing contracts other than having them with the producer is keeping them in a common place.
It can be related to security issues where the consumers can&#8217;t clone the producer&#8217;s code. Also if you keep
contracts in a single place then you, as a producer, will know how many consumers you have and which
consumer you will break with your local changes.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_repo_structure">
<title>Repo structure</title>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s assume that we have a producer with coordinates <literal>com.example:server</literal> and 3 consumers: <literal>client1</literal>,
<literal>client2</literal>, <literal>client3</literal>. Then in the repository with common contracts you would have the following setup
(which you can checkout <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/tree/2.1.x/samples/standalone/contracts">here</link>):</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">├── com

<simpara>As you can see under the slash-delimited groupid <literal>/</literal> artifact id folder (<literal>com/example/server</literal>) you have
expectations of the 3 consumers (<literal>client1</literal>, <literal>client2</literal> and <literal>client3</literal>). Expectations are the standard Groovy DSL
contract files as described throughout this documentation. This repository has to produce a JAR file that maps
one to one to the contents of the repo.</simpara>
<simpara>Example of a <literal>pom.xml</literal> inside the <literal>server</literal> folder.</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

<title>Workflow</title>
<simpara>The workflow would look similar to the one presented in the <literal>Step by step guide to CDC</literal>. The only difference
 is that the producer doesn&#8217;t own the contracts anymore. So the consumer and the producer have to work on
 common contracts in a common repository.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_consumer">
<title>Consumer</title>
<simpara>When the <emphasis role="strong">consumer</emphasis> wants to work on the contracts offline, instead of cloning the producer code, the
consumer team clones the common repository, goes to the required producer&#8217;s folder (e.g. <literal>com/example/server</literal>)
and runs <literal>mvn clean install -DskipTests</literal> to install locally the stubs converted from the contracts.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_producer">
<title>Producer</title>
<simpara>As a <emphasis role="strong">producer</emphasis> it&#8217;s enough to alter the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier to provide the URL and the dependency
of the JAR containing the contracts:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;plugin&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;

	&lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>With this setup the JAR with groupid <literal>com.example.standalone</literal> and artifactid <literal>contracts</literal> will be downloaded
from <literal><link xl:href="http://link/to/your/nexus/or/artifactory/or/sth">http://link/to/your/nexus/or/artifactory/or/sth</link></literal>. It will be then unpacked in a local temporary folder
and contracts present under the <literal>com/example/server</literal> will be picked as the ones used to generate the
tests and the stubs. Due to this convention the producer team will know which consumer teams will be broken
when some incompatible changes are done.</simpara>
<simpara>The rest of the flow looks the same.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_how_can_i_define_messaging_contracts_per_topic_not_per_producer">

mechanisms to store contracts and stubs in a SCM repository. Currently the

<listitem>
<simpara>we group applications via <literal>groupId</literal> (e.g. <literal>com.example</literal>)</simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara>then each application is represented via the <literal>artifactId</literal> (e.g. <literal>beer-api-producer-git</literal>)</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>next, the version of the application (e.g. <literal>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</literal>). Starting from Spring Cloud Contract version <literal>2.1.0</literal>, you can specify the versions as follows (assuming that your versions follow the semantic versioning)</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>if you have a version <literal>1.0.0.RELEASE</literal>, <literal>2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</literal> and <literal>2.0.0.RELEASE</literal> we will assume that the latest is <literal>2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</literal></simpara>

<listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>finally, there are two folders:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>contracts</literal> - the good practice is to store the contracts required by each
consumer in the folder with the consumer name (e.g. <literal>beer-api-consumer</literal>). That way you
can use the <literal>stubs-per-consumer</literal> feature. Further directory structure is arbitrary.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>mappings</literal> - in this folder the Maven / Gradle Spring Cloud Contract plugins will push
the stub server mappings. On the consumer side, Stub Runner will scan this folder
to start stub servers with stub definitions. The folder structure will be a copy
of the one created in the <literal>contracts</literal> subfolder.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<section xml:id="_protocol_convention">
<title>Protocol convention</title>
<simpara>In order to control the type and location of the source of contracts (whether it&#8217;s
a binary storage or an SCM repository), you can use the protocol in the URL of
the repository. Spring Cloud Contract iterates over registered protocol resolvers
and tries to fetch the contracts (via a plugin) or stubs (via Stub Runner).</simpara>
<simpara>For the SCM functionality, currently, we support the Git repository. To use it,
in the property, where the repository URL needs to be placed you just have to prefix
the connection URL with <literal>git://</literal>. Here you can find a couple of examples:</simpara>
<screen>git://file:///foo/bar
git://https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/spring-cloud-contract-nodejs-contracts-git.git
git://git@github.com:spring-cloud-samples/spring-cloud-contract-nodejs-contracts-git.git</screen>
</section>
<section xml:id="_producer_2">
<title>Producer</title>
<simpara>For the producer, to use the SCM approach, we can reuse the
same mechanism we use for external contracts. We route Spring Cloud Contract
to use the SCM implementation via the URL that contains
the <literal>git://</literal> protocol.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>You have to manually add the <literal>pushStubsToScm</literal>
goal in Maven or execute (bind) the <literal>pushStubsToScm</literal> task in
Gradle. We don&#8217;t push stubs to <literal>origin</literal> of your git
repository out of the box.</simpara>

2.0.0 one can fetch Pact files from the Pact Broker to generate

You can read more about it in the <xref linkend="pact-converter"/> section.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>Pact follows the Consumer Contract convention. That means
that the Consumer creates the Pact definitions first, then
shares the files with the Producer. Those expectations are generated
from the Consumer&#8217;s code and can break the Producer if the expectations
are not met.</simpara>

If more than  one level of nested directories is present, all except the last one is used
as the package name. For example, with following structure:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">src/test/resources/contracts/myservice/shouldCreateUser.groovy

only option to test the JAX-RS API is to start a web server.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="gradle-different-base-classes">
<title>Different Base Classes for Contracts</title>
<simpara>If your base classes differ between contracts, you can tell the Spring Cloud Contract
plugin which class should get extended by the autogenerated tests. You have two options:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Follow a convention by providing the <literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Provide explicit mapping via <literal>baseClassMappings</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">By Convention</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>The convention is such that if you have a contract under (for example)
<literal>src/test/resources/contract/foo/bar/baz/</literal> and set the value of the
<literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal> property to <literal>com.example.base</literal>, then Spring Cloud Contract
Verifier assumes that there is a <literal>BarBazBase</literal> class under the <literal>com.example.base</literal> package.
In other words, the system takes the last two parts of the package, if they exist, and
forms a class with a <literal>Base</literal> suffix. This rule takes precedence over <emphasis role="strong">baseClassForTests</emphasis>.
Here is an example of how it works in the <literal>contracts</literal> closure:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">packageWithBaseClasses = 'com.example.base'</programlisting>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">By Mapping</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>You can manually map a regular expression of the contract&#8217;s package to fully qualified
name of the base class for the matched contract. You have to provide a list called
<literal>baseClassMappings</literal> that consists <literal>baseClassMapping</literal> objects that takes a
<literal>contractPackageRegex</literal> to <literal>baseClassFQN</literal> mapping. Consider the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">baseClassForTests = "com.example.FooBase"
baseClassMappings {
	baseClassMapping('.*/com/.*', 'com.example.ComBase')
	baseClassMapping('.*/bar/.*': 'com.example.BarBase')
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s assume that you have contracts under
 - <literal>src/test/resources/contract/com/</literal>
 - <literal>src/test/resources/contract/foo/</literal></simpara>
<simpara>By providing the <literal>baseClassForTests</literal>, we have a fallback in case mapping did not succeed.
(You could also provide the <literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal> as a fallback.) That way, the tests
generated from <literal>src/test/resources/contract/com/</literal> contracts extend the
<literal>com.example.ComBase</literal>, whereas the rest of the tests extend <literal>com.example.FooBase</literal>.</simpara>

<title>Add stubs</title>
<simpara>By default, Spring Cloud Contract Verifier is looking for stubs in the
<literal>src/test/resources/contracts</literal> directory. The directory containing stub definitions is
treated as a class name, and each stub definition is treated as a single test. We assume
that it contains at least one directory to be used as test class name. If there is more
than one level of nested directories, all except the last one is used as package name.
For example, with following structure:</simpara>

<section xml:id="maven-different-base">
<title>Different base classes for contracts</title>
<simpara>If your base classes differ between contracts, you can tell the Spring Cloud Contract
plugin which class should get extended by the autogenerated tests. You have two options:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Follow a convention by providing the <literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>provide explicit mapping via <literal>baseClassMappings</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">By Convention</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>The convention is such that if you have a contract under (for example)
<literal>src/test/resources/contract/foo/bar/baz/</literal> and set the value of the
<literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal> property to <literal>com.example.base</literal>, then Spring Cloud Contract
Verifier assumes that there is a <literal>BarBazBase</literal> class under the <literal>com.example.base</literal> package.
In other words, the system takes the last two parts of the package, if they exist, and
forms a class with a <literal>Base</literal> suffix. This rule takes precedence over <emphasis role="strong">baseClassForTests</emphasis>.
Here is an example of how it works in the <literal>contracts</literal> closure:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;plugin&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;configuration&gt;
		&lt;packageWithBaseClasses&gt;hello&lt;/packageWithBaseClasses&gt;
	&lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">By Mapping</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>You can manually map a regular expression of the contract&#8217;s package to fully qualified
name of the base class for the matched contract. You have to provide a list called
<literal>baseClassMappings</literal> that consists <literal>baseClassMapping</literal> objects that takes a
<literal>contractPackageRegex</literal> to <literal>baseClassFQN</literal> mapping. Consider the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;plugin&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;configuration&gt;
		&lt;baseClassForTests&gt;com.example.FooBase&lt;/baseClassForTests&gt;
		&lt;baseClassMappings&gt;
			&lt;baseClassMapping&gt;
				&lt;contractPackageRegex&gt;.*com.*&lt;/contractPackageRegex&gt;
				&lt;baseClassFQN&gt;com.example.TestBase&lt;/baseClassFQN&gt;
			&lt;/baseClassMapping&gt;
		&lt;/baseClassMappings&gt;
	&lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Assume that you have contracts under these two locations:
* <literal>src/test/resources/contract/com/</literal>
* <literal>src/test/resources/contract/foo/</literal></simpara>
<simpara>By providing the <literal>baseClassForTests</literal>, we have a fallback in case mapping did not succeed.
(You can also provide the <literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal> as a fallback.) That way, the tests
generated from <literal>src/test/resources/contract/com/</literal> contracts extend the
<literal>com.example.ComBase</literal>, whereas the rest of the tests extend <literal>com.example.FooBase</literal>.</simpara>

        &lt;!-- We reuse the contract dependency section to set up the path

<title>Maven Plugin with Spock Tests</title>
<simpara>You can select the <link xl:href="http://spockframework.org/">Spock Framework</link> for creating and executing the auto-generated contract
verification tests with both Maven and Gradle plugin. However, whereas with Gradle its really straightforward,
in Maven you will require some additional setup in order to make the tests compile and execute properly.</simpara>
<simpara>First of all, you will have to use a plugin, such as <link xl:href="https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus">GMavenPlus</link> plugin,
to add Groovy to your project. In GMavenPlus plugin, you will need to explicitly set test sources, including both the
path where your base test classes are defined and the path were the generated contract tests are added.
Please refer to the example below:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered"></programlisting>
<simpara>If you uphold to the Spock convention of ending the test class names with <literal>Spec</literal>, you will also need to adjust your Maven
Surefire plugin setup, like in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered"></programlisting>

<section xml:id="_stubs_and_transitive_dependencies">
<title>Stubs and Transitive Dependencies</title>
<simpara>The Maven and Gradle plugin that add the tasks that create the stubs jar for you. One
problem that arises is that, when reusing the stubs, you can mistakenly import all of
that stub&#8217;s dependencies. When building a Maven artifact, even though you have a couple
of different jars, all of them share one pom:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-20160903.075506-1-stubs.jar
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-20160903.075506-1-stubs.jar.sha1
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-20160903.075655-2-stubs.jar
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-20160903.075655-2-stubs.jar.sha1

├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.pom
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT-stubs.jar
├── ...
└── ...</programlisting>
<simpara>There are three possibilities of working with those dependencies so as not to have any
issues with transitive dependencies:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Mark all application dependencies as optional</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Create a separate artifactid for the stubs</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Exclude dependencies on the consumer side</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Mark all application dependencies as optional</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>If, in the <literal>github-webhook</literal> application, you mark all of your dependencies as optional,
when you include the <literal>github-webhook</literal> stubs in another application (or when that
dependency gets downloaded by Stub Runner) then, since all of the dependencies are
optional, they will not get downloaded.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Create a separate <literal>artifactid</literal> for the stubs</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>If you create a separate <literal>artifactid</literal>, then you can set it up in whatever way you wish.
For example, you might decide to have no dependencies at all.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Exclude dependencies on the consumer side</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>As a consumer, if you add the stub dependency to your classpath, you can explicitly
exclude the unwanted dependencies.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_scenarios">
<title>Scenarios</title>
<simpara>You can handle scenarios with Spring Cloud Contract Verifier. All you need to do is to
stick to the proper naming convention while creating your contracts. The convention
requires including an order number followed by an underscore. This will work regardles
 of whether you&#8217;re working with YAML or Groovy. Example:</simpara>
<screen>my_contracts_dir\
  scenario1\
    1_login.groovy
    2_showCart.groovy
    3_logout.groovy</screen>
<simpara>Such a tree causes Spring Cloud Contract Verifier to generate WireMock&#8217;s scenario with a
name of <literal>scenario1</literal> and the three following steps:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>login marked as <literal>Started</literal> pointing to&#8230;&#8203;</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>showCart marked as <literal>Step1</literal> pointing to&#8230;&#8203;</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>logout marked as <literal>Step2</literal> which will close the scenario.</simpara>

</orderedlist>
<simpara>More details about WireMock scenarios can be found at
<link xl:href="https://wiremock.org/docs/stateful-behaviour/">https://wiremock.org/docs/stateful-behaviour/</link></simpara>

<title>Docker Project</title>
<simpara>We&#8217;re publishing a <literal>springcloud/spring-cloud-contract</literal> Docker image
that contains a project that will generate tests and execute them in <literal>EXPLICIT</literal> mode
against a running application.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>The <literal>EXPLICIT</literal> mode means that the tests generated from contracts will send
real requests and not the mocked ones.</simpara>
</tip>
<section xml:id="_short_intro_to_maven_jars_and_binary_storage">
<title>Short intro to Maven, JARs and Binary storage</title>
<simpara>Since the Docker image can be used by non JVM projects, it&#8217;s good to
explain the basic terms behind Spring Cloud Contract packaging defaults.</simpara>
<simpara>Part of the following definitions were taken from the <link xl:href="https://maven.apache.org/glossary.html">Maven Glossary</link></simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>Project</literal>: Maven thinks in terms of projects. Everything that you
will build are projects. Those projects follow a well defined
“Project Object Model”. Projects can depend on other projects,
in which case the latter are called “dependencies”. A project may
consistent of several subprojects, however these subprojects are still
treated equally as projects.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>Artifact</literal>: An artifact is something that is either produced or used
by a project. Examples of artifacts produced by Maven for a project
include: JARs, source and binary distributions. Each artifact
is uniquely identified by a group id and an artifact ID which is
unique within a group.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>JAR</literal>: JAR stands for Java ARchive. It&#8217;s a format based on
the ZIP file format. Spring Cloud Contract packages the contracts and generated
stubs in a JAR file.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>GroupId</literal>: A group ID is a universally unique identifier for a project.
While this is often just the project name (eg. commons-collections),
it is helpful to use a fully-qualified package name to distinguish it
from other projects with a similar name (eg. org.apache.maven).
Typically, when published to the Artifact Manager, the <literal>GroupId</literal> will get
slash separated and form part of the URL. E.g. for group id <literal>com.example</literal>
and artifact id <literal>application</literal> would be <literal>/com/example/application/</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>Classifier</literal>: The Maven dependency notation looks as follows:
<literal>groupId:artifactId:version:classifier</literal>. The classifier is additional suffix
passed to the dependency. E.g. <literal>stubs</literal>, <literal>sources</literal>. The same dependency
e.g. <literal>com.example:application</literal> can produce multiple artifacts that
differ from each other with the classifier.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>Artifact manager</literal>: When you generate binaries / sources / packages, you would
like them to be available for others to download / reference or reuse. In case
of the JVM world those artifacts would be JARs, for Ruby these are gems
and for Docker those would be Docker images. You can store those artifacts
in a manager. Examples of such managers can be <link xl:href="https://jfrog.com/artifactory/">Artifactory</link>
or <link xl:href="https://www.sonatype.org/nexus/">Nexus</link>.</simpara>

<title>Configuring HTTP Server Stubs</title>
<simpara>Stub Runner has a notion of a <literal>HttpServerStub</literal> that abstracts the underlaying
concrete implementation of the HTTP server (e.g. WireMock is one of the implementations).
Sometimes, you need to perform some additional tuning of the stub servers,
that is concrete for the given implementation. To do that, Stub Runner gives you
the <literal>httpServerStubConfigurer</literal> property that is available in the annotation,
JUnit rule, and is accessible via system properties, where you can provide
your implementation of the <literal>org.springframework.cloud.contract.stubrunner.HttpServerStubConfigurer</literal> interface. The implementations can alter
the configuration files for the given HTTP server stub.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner comes with an implementation that you
can extend, for WireMock - <literal>org.springframework.cloud.contract.stubrunner.provider.wiremock.WireMockHttpServerStubConfigurer</literal>. In the <literal>configure</literal> method
you can provide your own, custom configuration for the given stub. The use
case might be starting WireMock for the given artifact id, on an HTTPs port. Example:</simpara>

<section xml:id="_stub_runner_boot_with_service_discovery">
<title>Stub Runner Boot with Service Discovery</title>
<simpara>One of the possibilities of using Stub Runner Boot is to use it as a feed of stubs for "smoke-tests". What does it mean?
 Let&#8217;s assume that you don&#8217;t want to deploy 50 microservice to a test environment in order
 to check if your application is working fine. You&#8217;ve already executed a suite of tests during the build process
 but you would also like to ensure that the packaging of your application is fine. What you can do
 is to deploy your application to an environment, start it and run a couple of tests on it to see if
 it&#8217;s working fine. We can call those tests smoke-tests since their idea is to check only a handful
 of testing scenarios.</simpara>
<simpara>The problem with this approach is such that if you&#8217;re doing microservices most likely you&#8217;re
 using a service discovery tool. Stub Runner Boot allows you to solve this issue by starting the
 required stubs and register them in a service discovery tool. Let&#8217;s take a look at an example of
 such a setup with Eureka. Let&#8217;s assume that Eureka was already running.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@EnableStubRunnerServer
@EnableEurekaClient
@AutoConfigureStubRunner
public class StubRunnerBootEurekaExample {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(StubRunnerBootEurekaExample.class, args);
	}

}</programlisting>
<simpara>As you can see we want to start a Stub Runner Boot server <literal>@EnableStubRunnerServer</literal>, enable Eureka client <literal>@EnableEurekaClient</literal>
and we want to have the stub runner feature turned on <literal>@AutoConfigureStubRunner</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Now let&#8217;s assume that we want to start this application so that the stubs get automatically registered.
 We can do it by running the app <literal>java -jar ${SYSTEM_PROPS} stub-runner-boot-eureka-example.jar</literal> where
 <literal>${SYSTEM_PROPS}</literal> would contain the following list of properties</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">* -Dstubrunner.repositoryRoot=https://repo.spring.io/snapshot (1)
* -Dstubrunner.cloud.stubbed.discovery.enabled=false (2)
* -Dstubrunner.ids=org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.stubs:loanIssuance,org.
* springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.stubs:fraudDetectionServer,org.springframework.
* cloud.contract.verifier.stubs:bootService (3)
* -Dstubrunner.idsToServiceIds.fraudDetectionServer=
* someNameThatShouldMapFraudDetectionServer (4)
*
* (1) - we tell Stub Runner where all the stubs reside (2) - we don't want the default
* behaviour where the discovery service is stubbed. That's why the stub registration will
* be picked (3) - we provide a list of stubs to download (4) - we provide a list of</programlisting>
<simpara>That way your deployed application can send requests to started WireMock servers via the service
discovery. Most likely points 1-3 could be set by default in <literal>application.yml</literal> cause they are not
likely to change. That way you can provide only the list of stubs to download whenever you start
the Stub Runner Boot.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_stubs_per_consumer">
<title>Stubs Per Consumer</title>
<simpara>There are cases in which 2 consumers of the same endpoint want to have 2 different responses.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>This approach also allows you to immediately know which consumer is using which part of your API.
You can remove part of a response that your API produces and you can see which of your autogenerated tests
fails. If none fails then you can safely delete that part of the response cause nobody is using it.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s look at the following example for contract defined for the producer called <literal>producer</literal>.
There are 2 consumers: <literal>foo-consumer</literal> and <literal>bar-consumer</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Consumer <literal>foo-service</literal></emphasis></simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">request {
   url '/foo'
   method GET()
}
response {
    status OK()
    body(
       foo: "foo"
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Consumer <literal>bar-service</literal></emphasis></simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">request {
   url '/foo'
   method GET()
}
response {
    status OK()
    body(
       bar: "bar"
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>You can&#8217;t produce for the same request 2 different responses. That&#8217;s why you can properly package the
contracts and then profit from the <literal>stubsPerConsumer</literal> feature.</simpara>
<simpara>On the producer side the consumers can have a folder that contains contracts related only to them.
By setting the <literal>stubrunner.stubs-per-consumer</literal> flag to <literal>true</literal> we no longer register all stubs but only those that
correspond to the consumer application&#8217;s name. In other words we&#8217;ll scan the path of every stub and
if it contains the subfolder with name of the consumer in the path only then will it get registered.</simpara>
<simpara>On the <literal>foo</literal> producer side the contracts would look like this</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">.
└── contracts
    ├── bar-consumer
    │   ├── bookReturnedForBar.groovy
    │   └── shouldCallBar.groovy
    └── foo-consumer
        ├── bookReturnedForFoo.groovy
        └── shouldCallFoo.groovy</programlisting>
<simpara>Being the <literal>bar-consumer</literal> consumer you can either set the <literal>spring.application.name</literal> or the <literal>stubrunner.consumer-name</literal> to <literal>bar-consumer</literal>
Or set the test as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">@ContextConfiguration(classes = Config, loader = SpringBootContextLoader)
@SpringBootTest(properties = ["spring.application.name=bar-consumer"])
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = "org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.stubs:producerWithMultipleConsumers",
		repositoryRoot = "classpath:m2repo/repository/",
		stubsMode = StubRunnerProperties.StubsMode.REMOTE,
		stubsPerConsumer = true)
class StubRunnerStubsPerConsumerSpec extends Specification {
...
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Then only the stubs registered under a path that contains the <literal>bar-consumer</literal> in its name (i.e. those from the
<literal>src/test/resources/contracts/bar-consumer/some/contracts/&#8230;&#8203;</literal> folder) will be allowed to be referenced.</simpara>
<simpara>Or set the consumer name explicitly</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">@ContextConfiguration(classes = Config, loader = SpringBootContextLoader)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = "org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.stubs:producerWithMultipleConsumers",
		repositoryRoot = "classpath:m2repo/repository/",
		consumerName = "foo-consumer",
		stubsMode = StubRunnerProperties.StubsMode.REMOTE,
		stubsPerConsumer = true)
class StubRunnerStubsPerConsumerWithConsumerNameSpec extends Specification {
...
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Then only the stubs registered under a path that contains the <literal>foo-consumer</literal> in its name (i.e. those from the
<literal>src/test/resources/contracts/foo-consumer/some/contracts/&#8230;&#8203;</literal> folder) will be allowed to be referenced.</simpara>

<title>Stub Runner for Messaging</title>
<simpara>Stub Runner can run the published stubs in memory. It can integrate with the following
frameworks:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Spring Integration</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Apache Camel</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Spring AMQP</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>It also provides entry points to integrate with any other solution on the market.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>If you have multiple frameworks on the classpath Stub Runner will need to
define which one should be used. Let&#8217;s assume that you have both AMQP, Spring Cloud Stream and Spring Integration
on the classpath. Then you need to set <literal>stubrunner.stream.enabled=false</literal> and <literal>stubrunner.integration.enabled=false</literal>.
That way the only remaining framework is Spring AMQP.</simpara>

<title>Stub Runner Spring AMQP</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier Stub Runner&#8217;s messaging module provides an easy way to
integrate with Spring AMQP&#8217;s Rabbit Template. For the provided artifacts, it
automatically downloads the stubs and registers the required routes.</simpara>
<simpara>The integration tries to work standalone (that is, without interaction with a running
RabbitMQ message broker). It expects a <literal>RabbitTemplate</literal> on the application context and
uses it as a spring boot test named <literal>@SpyBean</literal>. As a result, it can use the mockito spy
functionality to verify and inspect messages sent by the application.</simpara>
<simpara>On the message consumer side, the stub runner considers all <literal>@RabbitListener</literal> annotated
endpoints and all <literal>SimpleMessageListenerContainer</literal> objects on the application context.</simpara>
<simpara>As messages are usually sent to exchanges in AMQP, the message contract contains the
exchange name as the destination. Message listeners on the other side are bound to
queues. Bindings connect an exchange to a queue. If message contracts are triggered, the
Spring AMQP stub runner integration looks for bindings on the application context that
match this exchange. Then it collects the queues from the Spring exchanges and tries to
find message listeners bound to these queues. The message is triggered for all matching
message listeners.</simpara>
<simpara>If you need to work with routing keys, it&#8217;s enough to pass them via the <literal>amqp_receivedRoutingKey</literal>

<simpara>Assume that you have the following Maven repository with a deployed stubs for the

<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">├── META-INF

<simpara>Consider the following contract:</simpara>

follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">stubTrigger.trigger("contract-test.person.created.event")</programlisting>
<simpara>The message has a destination of <literal>contract-test.exchange</literal>, so the Spring AMQP stub runner

<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public Binding binding() {

<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean

<title>Contract DSL</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract supports out of the box 2 types of DSL. One written in
<literal>Groovy</literal> and one written in <literal>YAML</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>If you decide to write the contract in Groovy, do not be alarmed if you have not used Groovy
before. Knowledge of the language is not really needed, as the Contract DSL uses only a
tiny subset of it (only literals, method calls and closures). Also, the DSL is statically
typed, to make it programmer-readable without any knowledge of the DSL itself.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>Remember that, inside the Groovy contract file, you have to provide the fully
qualified name to the <literal>Contract</literal> class and <literal>make</literal> static imports, such as
<literal>org.springframework.cloud.spec.Contract.make { &#8230;&#8203; }</literal>. You can also provide an import to
the <literal>Contract</literal> class: <literal>import org.springframework.cloud.spec.Contract</literal> and then call
<literal>Contract.make { &#8230;&#8203; }</literal>.</simpara>
</important>
<tip>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract supports defining multiple contracts in a single file.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>The following is a complete example of a Groovy contract definition:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered"></programlisting>
<simpara>The following is a complete example of a YAML contract definition:</simpara>

<title>Limitations</title>
<warning>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier does not properly support XML. Please use JSON or
help us implement this feature.</simpara>
</warning>
<warning>
<simpara>The support for verifying the size of JSON arrays is experimental. If you want
to turn it on, please set the value of the following system property to <literal>true</literal>:
<literal>spring.cloud.contract.verifier.assert.size</literal>. By default, this feature is set to <literal>false</literal>.
You can also provide the <literal>assertJsonSize</literal> property in the plugin configuration.</simpara>
</warning>
<warning>
<simpara>Because JSON structure can have any form, it can be impossible to parse it
properly when using the Groovy DSL and the <literal>value(consumer(&#8230;&#8203;), producer(&#8230;&#8203;))</literal> notation in <literal>GString</literal>. That
is why you should use the Groovy Map notation.</simpara>

<tip>
<simpara>Via the Groovy DSL you can reference the <literal>org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.internal.HttpStatus</literal>
methods to provide a meaningful status instead of a digit. E.g. you can call
<literal>OK()</literal> for a status <literal>200</literal> or <literal>BAD_REQUEST()</literal> for <literal>400</literal>.</simpara>
</tip>
</section>
<section xml:id="_dynamic_properties">
<title>Dynamic properties</title>
<simpara>The contract can contain some dynamic properties: timestamps, IDs, and so on. You do not
want to force the consumers to stub their clocks to always return the same value of time
so that it gets matched by the stub.</simpara>
<simpara>For Groovy DSL you can provide the dynamic parts in your contracts
in two ways: pass them directly in the body or set them in a separate section called
<literal>bodyMatchers</literal>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Before 2.0.0 these were set using <literal>testMatchers</literal> and <literal>stubMatchers</literal>,
check out the <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/wiki/Spring-Cloud-Contract-2.0-Migration-Guide">migration guide</link> for more information.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>For YAML you can only use the <literal>matchers</literal> section.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_dynamic_properties_inside_the_body">
<title>Dynamic properties inside the body</title>
<important>
<simpara>This section is valid only for Groovy DSL. Check out the
<xref linkend="contract-matchers"/> section for YAML examples of a similar feature.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>You can set the properties inside the body either with the <literal>value</literal> method or, if you use
the Groovy map notation, with <literal>$()</literal>. The following example shows how to set dynamic
properties with the value method:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">value(consumer(...), producer(...))
value(c(...), p(...))
value(stub(...), test(...))
value(client(...), server(...))</programlisting>
<simpara>The following example shows how to set dynamic properties with <literal>$()</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">$(consumer(...), producer(...))
$(c(...), p(...))
$(stub(...), test(...))
$(client(...), server(...))</programlisting>
<simpara>Both approaches work equally well. <literal>stub</literal> and <literal>client</literal> methods are aliases over the <literal>consumer</literal>
method. Subsequent sections take a closer look at what you can do with those values.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_regular_expressions">
<title>Regular expressions</title>
<important>
<simpara>This section is valid only for Groovy DSL. Check out the
<xref linkend="contract-matchers"/> section for YAML examples of a similar feature.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>You can use regular expressions to write your requests in Contract DSL. Doing so is
particularly useful when you want to indicate that a given response should be provided
for requests that follow a given pattern. Also, you can use regular expressions when you
need to use patterns and not exact values both for your test and your server side tests.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows how to use regular expressions to write a request:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
	request {
		method('GET')
		url $(consumer(~/\/[0-9]{2}/), producer('/12'))
	}
	response {
		status OK()
		body(
				id: $(anyNumber()),
				surname: $(
						consumer('Kowalsky'),
						producer(regex('[a-zA-Z]+'))
				),
				name: 'Jan',
				created: $(consumer('2014-02-02 12:23:43'), producer(execute('currentDate(it)'))),
				correlationId: value(consumer('5d1f9fef-e0dc-4f3d-a7e4-72d2220dd827'),
						producer(regex('[a-fA-F0-9]{8}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{12}'))
				)
		)
		headers {
			header 'Content-Type': 'text/plain'
		}
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>You can also provide only one side of the communication with a regular expression. If you
do so, then the contract engine automatically provides the generated string that matches
the provided regular expression. The following code shows an example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
	request {
		method 'PUT'
		url value(consumer(regex('/foo/[0-9]{5}')))
		body([
				requestElement: $(consumer(regex('[0-9]{5}')))
		])
		headers {
			header('header', $(consumer(regex('application\\/vnd\\.fraud\\.v1\\+json;.*'))))
		}
	}
	response {
		status OK()
		body([
				responseElement: $(producer(regex('[0-9]{7}')))
		])
		headers {
			contentType("application/vnd.fraud.v1+json")
		}
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In the preceding example, the opposite side of the communication has the respective data
generated for request and response.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract comes with a series of predefined regular expressions that you can
use in your contracts, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">protected static final Pattern TRUE_OR_FALSE = Pattern.compile(/(true|false)/)

<simpara>In your contract, you can use it as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">Contract dslWithOptionalsInString = Contract.make {
	priority 1
	request {

				message: "User not found by email = [${value(producer(regex(email())), consumer('not.existing@user.com'))}]"
		)
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>To make matters even simpler you can use a set of predefined objects that will automatically assume that you want a regular expression to be passed.
All of those methods start with <literal>any</literal> prefix:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">T anyAlphaUnicode()

T anyAlphaNumeric()

T anyTime()

T anyIso8601WithOffset()

T anyNonBlankString()

T anyNonEmptyString()

<simpara>and this is an example of how you can reference those methods:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">Contract contractDsl = Contract.make {

<simpara>It is possible to provide optional parameters in your contract. However, you can provide
optional parameters only for the following:</simpara>

	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>By wrapping a part of the body with the <literal>optional()</literal> method, you create a regular

<simpara>If you use Spock for, the following test would be generated from the previous example:</simpara>

    .post("/users/password")

 then:
  response.statusCode == 404
  response.header('Content-Type')  == 'application/json'
 and:
  DocumentContext parsedJson = JsonPath.parse(response.body.asString())
  assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("['code']").matches("(123123)?")

	}

}</programlisting>
<important>
<simpara>You cannot use both a String and <literal>execute</literal> to perform concatenation. For
example, calling <literal>header('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + execute('authToken()'))</literal> leads to
improper results. Instead, call <literal>header('Authorization', execute('authToken()'))</literal> and
ensure that the <literal>authToken()</literal> method returns everything you need.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>The type of the object read from the JSON can be one of the following, depending on the
JSON path:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>String</literal>: If you point to a <literal>String</literal> value in the JSON.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>JSONArray</literal>: If you point to a <literal>List</literal> in the JSON.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>Map</literal>: If you point to a <literal>Map</literal> in the JSON.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>Number</literal>: If you point to <literal>Integer</literal>, <literal>Double</literal> etc. in the JSON.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>Boolean</literal>: If you point to a <literal>Boolean</literal> in the JSON.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>In the request part of the contract, you can specify that the <literal>body</literal> should be taken from
a method.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>You must provide both the consumer and the producer side. The <literal>execute</literal> part
is applied for the whole body - not for parts of it.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>The following example shows how to read an object from JSON:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">Contract contractDsl = Contract.make {
	request {
		method 'GET'
		url '/something'
		body(
				$(c('foo'), p(execute('hashCode()')))
		)
	}
	response {
		status OK()
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The preceding example results in calling the <literal>hashCode()</literal> method in the request body.
It should resemble the following code:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// given:
 MockMvcRequestSpecification request = given()
   .body(hashCode());

// when:
 ResponseOptions response = given().spec(request)
   .get("/something");

// then:
 assertThat(response.statusCode()).isEqualTo(200);</programlisting>

<title>Referencing the Request from the Response</title>
<simpara>The best situation is to provide fixed values, but sometimes you need to reference a
request in your response.</simpara>
<simpara>If you&#8217;re writing contracts using Groovy DSL, you can use the <literal>fromRequest()</literal> method, which lets

<simpara>This feature works only with WireMock having a version greater than or equal

proper values. Additionally, it registers two helper functions:</simpara>

<section xml:id="_registering_your_own_wiremock_extension">
<title>Registering Your Own WireMock Extension</title>
<simpara>WireMock lets you register custom extensions. By default, Spring Cloud Contract registers
the transformer, which lets you reference a request from a response. If you want to
provide your own extensions, you can register an implementation of the
<literal>org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.dsl.wiremock.WireMockExtensions</literal> interface.
Since we use the spring.factories extension approach, you can create an entry in
<literal>META-INF/spring.factories</literal> file similar to the following:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.dsl.wiremock.WireMockExtensions=\

<simpara>If you work with <link xl:href="https://docs.pact.io/">Pact</link>, the following discussion may seem familiar.
Quite a few users are used to having a separation between the body and setting the
dynamic parts of a contract.</simpara>
<simpara>You can use the <literal>bodyMatchers</literal> section for two reasons:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Define the dynamic values that should end up in a stub.
You can set it in the <literal>request</literal> or <literal>inputMessage</literal> part of your contract.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Verify the result of your test.
This section is present in the <literal>response</literal> or <literal>outputMessage</literal> side of the
contract.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Currently, Spring Cloud Contract Verifier supports only JSON Path-based matchers with the
following matching possibilities:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<title>Groovy DSL</title>
<listitem>
<simpara>For the stubs(in tests on the Consumer&#8217;s side):</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

<literal>byType</literal> can take a closure, in which you can set <literal>minOccurrence</literal> and <literal>maxOccurrence</literal>. For the request side, you should use the closure to assert size of the collection.
That way, you can assert the size of the flattened collection. To check the size of an

<listitem>
<simpara><literal>byCommand(&#8230;&#8203;)</literal>: The value taken from the producer&#8217;s response via the provided JSON Path is

<literal>byCommand('foo($it)')</literal> results in calling a <literal>foo</literal> method to which the value matching the
JSON Path gets passed. The type of the object read from the JSON can be one of the

<simpara>In the preceding example, you can see the dynamic portions of the contract in the
<literal>matchers</literal> sections. For the request part, you can see that, for all fields but
<literal>valueWithoutAMatcher</literal>, the values of the regular expressions that the stub should
contain are explicitly set. For the <literal>valueWithoutAMatcher</literal>, the verification takes place
in the same way as without the use of matchers. In that case, the test performs an
equality check.</simpara>
<simpara>For the response side in the <literal>bodyMatchers</literal> section, we define the dynamic parts in a
similar manner. The only difference is that the <literal>byType</literal> matchers are also present. The
verifier engine checks four fields to verify whether the response from the test
has a value for which the JSON path matches the given field, is of the same type as the one
defined in the response body, and passes the following check (based on the method being called):</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>For <literal>$.valueWithTypeMatch</literal>, the engine checks whether the type is the same.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>For <literal>$.valueWithMin</literal>, the engine check the type and asserts whether the size is greater
than or equal to the minimum occurrence.</simpara>

<simpara>For REST contracts, we also support XML request and response body.
The XML body has to be passed within the <literal>body</literal> element

both request and response. In place of the <literal>jsonPath(&#8230;&#8203;)</literal> method, the <literal>org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.internal.BodyMatchers.xPath</literal>

<simpara>In the preceding example, one contract has the <literal>name</literal> field and the other does not. This

<simpara>Notice that, for the contract that has the <literal>name</literal> field, the generated test method is named
<literal>validate_should_post_a_user</literal>. For the one that does not have the name, it is called
<literal>validate_withList_1</literal>. It corresponds to the name of the file <literal>WithList.groovy</literal> and the
index of the contract in the list.</simpara>
<simpara>The generated stubs is shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>should post a user.json
1_WithList.json</screen>
<simpara>As you can see, the first file got the <literal>name</literal> parameter from the contract. The second
got the name of the contract file (<literal>WithList.groovy</literal>) prefixed with the index (in this
case, the contract had an index of <literal>1</literal> in the list of contracts in the file).</simpara>

<simpara>As you can see, it is much better if you name your contracts because doing so makes
your tests far more meaningful.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_using_the_pluggable_architecture">
<title>Using the Pluggable Architecture</title>
<simpara>You may encounter cases where you have your contracts have been defined in other formats,
such as YAML, RAML or PACT. In those cases, you still want to benefit from the automatic
generation of tests and stubs. You can add your own implementation for generating both
tests and stubs. Also, you can customize the way tests are generated (for example, you
can generate tests for other languages) and the way stubs are generated (for example, you
can generate stubs for other HTTP server implementations).</simpara>

	 * to check if the conversion is possible.
	 *
	 * @param file - file to be considered for conversion
	 * @return - {@code true} if the given implementation can convert the file
	 */

	 *
	 * @param contract - the parsed contract
	 * @return - {@link T} the type to which we do the conversion
	 */
	T convertTo(Collection&lt;Contract&gt; contract)
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Your implementation must define the condition on which it should start the
conversion. Also, you must define how to perform that conversion in both directions.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>Once you create your implementation, you must create a
<literal>/META-INF/spring.factories</literal> file in which you provide the fully qualified name of your
implementation.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>The following example shows a typical <literal>spring.factories</literal> file:</simpara>
<screen>org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.ContractConverter=\
org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.converter.YamlContractConverter</screen>
<section xml:id="pact-converter">
<title>Pact Converter</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract includes support for <link xl:href="https://docs.pact.io/">Pact</link> representation of
contracts up until v4. Instead of using the Groovy DSL, you can use Pact files. In this section, we
present how to add Pact support for your project. Note however that not all functionality is supported.
Starting with v3 you can combine multiple matcher for the same element;
you can use matchers for the body, headers, request and path; and you can use value generators.
Spring Cloud Contract currently only supports multiple matchers that are combined using the AND rule logic.
Next to that the request and path matchers are skipped during the conversion.
When using a date, time or datetime value generator with a given format,
the given format will be skipped and the ISO format will be used.</simpara>
<simpara>In order to properly support the Spring Cloud Contract way of doing messaging
with Pact you&#8217;ll have to provide some additional meta data entries. Below you can find a list of such entries:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>to define the destination to which a message gets sent, you have to
set a <literal>metaData</literal> entry in the Pact file, with key <literal>sentTo</literal> equal to the destination to which a message is to be sent. E.g. <literal>"metaData": { "sentTo": "activemq:output" }</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<section xml:id="_using_the_custom_stub_runner">
<title>Using the Custom Stub Runner</title>
<simpara>If you decide to use a custom stub generation, you also need a custom way of running

you have written a stub generator and placed your stubs in a JAR file.</simpara>
<simpara>In order for Stub Runner to know how to run your stubs, you have to define a custom

<chapter xml:id="_spring_cloud_contract_wiremock">
<title>Spring Cloud Contract WireMock</title>
<simpara>The Spring Cloud Contract WireMock modules let you use <link xl:href="https://github.com/tomakehurst/wiremock">WireMock</link> in a
Spring Boot application. Check out the
<link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/tree/2.1.x/samples">samples</link>
for more details.</simpara>
<simpara>If you have a Spring Boot application that uses Tomcat as an embedded server (which is
the default with <literal>spring-boot-starter-web</literal>),  you can add
<literal>spring-cloud-starter-contract-stub-runner</literal> to your classpath and add <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal> in
order to be able to use Wiremock in your tests. Wiremock runs as a stub server and you
can register stub behavior using a Java API or via static JSON declarations as part of
your test. The following code shows an example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@AutoConfigureWireMock(port = 0)
public class WiremockForDocsTests {

	// A service that calls out over HTTP
	@Autowired
	private Service service;

	@Before
	public void setup() {
		this.service.setBase("http://localhost:"
				+ this.environment.getProperty("wiremock.server.port"));
	}

	// Using the WireMock APIs in the normal way:
	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		// Stubbing WireMock
		stubFor(get(urlEqualTo("/resource")).willReturn(aResponse()
				.withHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain").withBody("Hello World!")));
		// We're asserting if WireMock responded properly
		assertThat(this.service.go()).isEqualTo("Hello World!");
	}

}</programlisting>
<simpara>To start the stub server on a different port use (for example),
<literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock(port=9999)</literal>. For a random port, use a value of <literal>0</literal>. The stub
server port can be bound in the test application context with the "wiremock.server.port"
property. Using <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal> adds a bean of type <literal>WiremockConfiguration</literal> to
your test application context, where it will be cached in between methods and classes
having the same context, the same as for Spring integration tests. Also you can inject a bean of type <literal>WireMockServer</literal> into your test.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_registering_stubs_automatically">
<title>Registering Stubs Automatically</title>
<simpara>If you use <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal>, it registers WireMock JSON stubs from the file
system or classpath (by default, from <literal>file:src/test/resources/mappings</literal>). You can
customize the locations using the <literal>stubs</literal> attribute in the annotation, which can be an
Ant-style resource pattern or a directory. In the case of a directory, <literal><emphasis role="strong">*/</emphasis>.json</literal> is
appended. The following code shows an example:</simpara>
<screen>@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureWireMock(stubs="classpath:/stubs")
public class WiremockImportApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private Service service;

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		assertThat(this.service.go()).isEqualTo("Hello World!");
	}

}</screen>
<note>
<simpara>Actually, WireMock always loads mappings from <literal>src/test/resources/mappings</literal> <emphasis role="strong">as
well as</emphasis> the custom locations in the stubs attribute. To change this behavior, you can
also specify a files root as described in the next section of this document.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>If you&#8217;re using Spring Cloud Contract&#8217;s default stub jars, then your
stubs are stored under <literal>/META-INF/group-id/artifact-id/versions/mappings/</literal> folder. If you want to register all stubs from that location, from all embedded JARs, then it&#8217;s enough to use the following syntax.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@AutoConfigureWireMock(port = 0, stubs = "classpath*:/META-INF/**/mappings/**/*.json")</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_using_files_to_specify_the_stub_bodies">
<title>Using Files to Specify the Stub Bodies</title>
<simpara>WireMock can read response bodies from files on the classpath or the file system. In that
case, you can see in the JSON DSL that the response has a <literal>bodyFileName</literal> instead of a
(literal) <literal>body</literal>. The files are resolved relative to a root directory (by default,
<literal>src/test/resources/__files</literal>). To customize this location you can set the <literal>files</literal>
attribute in the <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal> annotation to the location of the parent
directory (in other words, <literal>__files</literal> is a subdirectory). You can use Spring resource
notation to refer to <literal>file:&#8230;&#8203;</literal> or <literal>classpath:&#8230;&#8203;</literal> locations. Generic URLs are not
supported. A list of values can be given, in which case WireMock resolves the first file
that exists when it needs to find a response body.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>When you configure the <literal>files</literal> root, it also affects the
automatic loading of stubs, because they come from the root location
in a subdirectory called "mappings". The value of <literal>files</literal> has no
effect on the stubs loaded explicitly from the <literal>stubs</literal> attribute.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_alternative_using_junit_rules">
<title>Alternative: Using JUnit Rules</title>
<simpara>For a more conventional WireMock experience, you can use JUnit <literal>@Rules</literal> to start and stop
the server. To do so, use the <literal>WireMockSpring</literal> convenience class to obtain an <literal>Options</literal>
instance, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
public class WiremockForDocsClassRuleTests {

	// Start WireMock on some dynamic port
	// for some reason `dynamicPort()` is not working properly
	@ClassRule
	public static WireMockClassRule wiremock = new WireMockClassRule(
			WireMockSpring.options().dynamicPort());

	// A service that calls out over HTTP to wiremock's port
	@Autowired
	private Service service;

	@Before
	public void setup() {
		this.service.setBase("http://localhost:" + wiremock.port());
	}

	// Using the WireMock APIs in the normal way:
	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		// Stubbing WireMock
		wiremock.stubFor(get(urlEqualTo("/resource")).willReturn(aResponse()
				.withHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain").withBody("Hello World!")));
		// We're asserting if WireMock responded properly
		assertThat(this.service.go()).isEqualTo("Hello World!");
	}

}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>@ClassRule</literal> means that the server shuts down after all the methods in this class
have been run.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_relaxed_ssl_validation_for_rest_template">
<title>Relaxed SSL Validation for Rest Template</title>
<simpara>WireMock lets you stub a "secure" server with an "https" URL protocol. If your
application wants to contact that stub server in an integration test, it will find that
the SSL certificates are not valid (the usual problem with self-installed certificates).
The best option is often to re-configure the client to use "http". If that&#8217;s not an
option, you can ask Spring to configure an HTTP client that ignores SSL validation errors
(do so only for tests, of course).</simpara>
<simpara>To make this work with minimum fuss, you need to be using the Spring Boot
<literal>RestTemplateBuilder</literal> in your app, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public RestTemplate restTemplate(RestTemplateBuilder builder) {
	return builder.build();
}</programlisting>
<simpara>You need <literal>RestTemplateBuilder</literal> because the builder is passed through callbacks to
initialize it, so the SSL validation can be set up in the client at that point. This
happens automatically in your test if you are using the <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal>
annotation or the stub runner. If you use the JUnit <literal>@Rule</literal> approach, you need to add the
<literal>@AutoConfigureHttpClient</literal> annotation as well, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest("app.baseUrl=https://localhost:6443")
@AutoConfigureHttpClient
public class WiremockHttpsServerApplicationTests {

	@ClassRule
	public static WireMockClassRule wiremock = new WireMockClassRule(
			WireMockSpring.options().httpsPort(6443));
...
}</programlisting>
<simpara>If you are using <literal>spring-boot-starter-test</literal>, you have the Apache HTTP client on the
classpath and it is selected by the <literal>RestTemplateBuilder</literal> and configured to ignore SSL
errors. If you use the default <literal>java.net</literal> client, you do not need the annotation (but it
won&#8217;t do any harm). There is no support currently for other clients, but it may be added
in future releases.</simpara>
<simpara>To disable the custom <literal>RestTemplateBuilder</literal>, set the <literal>wiremock.rest-template-ssl-enabled</literal>
property to <literal>false</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_wiremock_and_spring_mvc_mocks">
<title>WireMock and Spring MVC Mocks</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract provides a convenience class that can load JSON WireMock stubs into

		// We're asserting if WireMock responded properly
		assertThat(this.service.go()).isEqualTo("Hello World");
		server.verify();
	}

}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>baseUrl</literal> value is prepended to all mock calls, and the <literal>stubs()</literal> method takes a stub
path resource pattern as an argument. In the preceding example, the stub defined at
<literal>/stubs/resource.json</literal> is loaded into the mock server. If the <literal>RestTemplate</literal> is asked to
visit <literal><link xl:href="https://example.org/">https://example.org/</link></literal>, it gets the responses as being declared at that URL. More
than one stub pattern can be specified, and each one can be a directory (for a recursive
list of all ".json"), a fixed filename (as in the example above), or an Ant-style
pattern. The JSON format is the normal WireMock format, which you can read about in the
<link xl:href="https://wiremock.org/docs/stubbing/">WireMock website</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>Currently, the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier supports Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow as
Spring Boot embedded servers, and Wiremock itself has "native" support for a particular
version of Jetty (currently 9.2). To use the native Jetty, you need to add the native
Wiremock dependencies and exclude the Spring Boot container (if there is one).</simpara>

<section xml:id="_customization_of_wiremock_configuration">
<title>Customization of WireMock configuration</title>
<simpara>You can register a bean of <literal>org.springframework.cloud.contract.wiremock.WireMockConfigurationCustomizer</literal> type
in order to customize the WireMock configuration (e.g. add custom transformers).
Example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">		@Bean

			return new WireMockConfigurationCustomizer() {
				@Override
				public void customize(WireMockConfiguration options) {

<section xml:id="_generating_stubs_using_rest_docs">
<title>Generating Stubs using REST Docs</title>
<simpara><link xl:href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-restdocs">Spring REST Docs</link> can be used to generate
documentation (for example in Asciidoctor format) for an HTTP API with Spring MockMvc
or <literal>WebTestClient</literal> or Rest Assured. At the same time that you generate documentation for your API, you can also
generate WireMock stubs by using Spring Cloud Contract WireMock. To do so, write your
normal REST Docs test cases and use <literal>@AutoConfigureRestDocs</literal> to have stubs be
automatically generated in the REST Docs output directory. The following code shows an
example using <literal>MockMvc</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureRestDocs(outputDir = "target/snippets")
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
public class ApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private MockMvc mockMvc;

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		mockMvc.perform(get("/resource"))
				.andExpect(content().string("Hello World"))
				.andDo(document("resource"));
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>This test generates a WireMock stub at "target/snippets/stubs/resource.json". It matches
all GET requests to the "/resource" path. The same example with <literal>WebTestClient</literal> (used
for testing Spring WebFlux applications) would look like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureRestDocs(outputDir = "target/snippets")
@AutoConfigureWebTestClient
public class ApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private WebTestClient client;

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		client.get().uri("/resource").exchange()
				.expectBody(String.class).isEqualTo("Hello World")
 				.consumeWith(document("resource"));
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Without any additional configuration, these tests create a stub with a request matcher
for the HTTP method and all headers except "host" and "content-length". To match the
request more precisely (for example, to match the body of a POST or PUT), we need to
explicitly create a request matcher. Doing so has two effects:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Creating a stub that matches only in the way you specify.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Asserting that the request in the test case also matches the same conditions.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The main entry point for this feature is <literal>WireMockRestDocs.verify()</literal>, which can be used
as a substitute for the <literal>document()</literal> convenience method, as shown in the following
example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">import static org.springframework.cloud.contract.wiremock.restdocs.WireMockRestDocs.verify;</programlisting>
<screen>@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureRestDocs(outputDir = "target/snippets")
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
public class ApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private MockMvc mockMvc;

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		mockMvc.perform(post("/resource")
                .content("{\"id\":\"123456\",\"message\":\"Hello World\"}"))
				.andExpect(status().isOk())
				.andDo(verify().jsonPath("$.id"))
                .andDo(document("resource"));
	}
}</screen>
<simpara>This contract specifies that any valid POST with an "id" field receives the response
defined in this test. You can chain together calls to <literal>.jsonPath()</literal> to add additional
matchers. If JSON Path is unfamiliar, The <link xl:href="https://github.com/jayway/JsonPath">JayWay
documentation</link> can help you get up to speed. The <literal>WebTestClient</literal> version of this test
has a similar <literal>verify()</literal> static helper that you insert in the same place.</simpara>
<simpara>Instead of the <literal>jsonPath</literal> and <literal>contentType</literal> convenience methods, you can also use the
WireMock APIs to verify that the request matches the created stub, as shown in the
following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Test
public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
	mockMvc.perform(post("/resource")
               .content("{\"id\":\"123456\",\"message\":\"Hello World\"}"))
			.andExpect(status().isOk())
			.andDo(verify()
					.wiremock(WireMock.post(
						urlPathEquals("/resource"))
						.withRequestBody(matchingJsonPath("$.id")))
                       .andDo(document("post-resource"));
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The WireMock API is rich. You can match headers, query parameters, and request body by
regex as well as by JSON path. These features can be used to create stubs with a wider
range of parameters. The above example generates a stub resembling the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>post-resource.json</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
  "request" : {
    "url" : "/resource",
    "method" : "POST",
    "bodyPatterns" : [ {
      "matchesJsonPath" : "$.id"
    }]
  },
  "response" : {
    "status" : 200,
    "body" : "Hello World",
    "headers" : {
      "X-Application-Context" : "application:-1",
      "Content-Type" : "text/plain"
    }
  }
}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<note>
<simpara>You can use either the <literal>wiremock()</literal> method or the <literal>jsonPath()</literal> and <literal>contentType()</literal>
methods to create request matchers, but you can&#8217;t use both approaches.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>On the consumer side, you can make the <literal>resource.json</literal> generated earlier in this section
available on the classpath (by
&lt;&lt;publishing-stubs-as-jars], for example). After that, you can create a stub using WireMock in a
number of different ways, including by using
<literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock(stubs="classpath:resource.json")</literal>, as described earlier in this
document.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_generating_contracts_by_using_rest_docs">
<title>Generating Contracts by Using REST Docs</title>
<simpara>You can also generate Spring Cloud Contract DSL files and documentation with Spring REST
Docs. If you do so in combination with Spring Cloud WireMock, you get both the contracts
and the stubs.</simpara>
<simpara>Why would you want to use this feature? Some people in the community asked questions
about a situation in which they would like to move to DSL-based contract definition,
but they already have a lot of Spring MVC tests. Using this feature lets you generate
the contract files that you can later modify and move to folders (defined in your
configuration) so that the plugin finds them.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>You might wonder why this functionality is in the WireMock module. The functionality
is there because it makes sense to generate both the contracts and the stubs.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>Consider the following test:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">		this.mockMvc
				.perform(post("/foo").accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_PDF)
						.accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
						.contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
						.content("{\"foo\": 23, \"bar\" : \"baz\" }"))
				.andExpect(status().isOk()).andExpect(content().string("bar"))
				// first WireMock
				.andDo(WireMockRestDocs.verify().jsonPath("$[?(@.foo &gt;= 20)]")
						.jsonPath("$[?(@.bar in ['baz','bazz','bazzz'])]")
						.contentType(MediaType.valueOf("application/json")))
				// then Contract DSL documentation
				.andDo(document("index", SpringCloudContractRestDocs.dslContract()));</programlisting>
<simpara>The preceding test creates the stub presented in the previous section, generating both
the contract and a documentation file.</simpara>
<simpara>The contract is called <literal>index.groovy</literal> and might look like the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">import org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract

Contract.make {
    request {
        method 'POST'
        url '/foo'
        body('''
            {"foo": 23 }
        ''')
        headers {
            header('''Accept''', '''application/json''')
            header('''Content-Type''', '''application/json''')
        }
    }
    response {
        status OK()
        body('''
        bar
        ''')
        headers {
            header('''Content-Type''', '''application/json;charset=UTF-8''')
            header('''Content-Length''', '''3''')
        }
        testMatchers {
            jsonPath('$[?(@.foo &gt;= 20)]', byType())
        }
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The generated document (formatted in Asciidoc in this case) contains a formatted
contract. The location of this file would be <literal>index/dsl-contract.adoc</literal>.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_new_structure_of_generated_stubs">
<title>New structure of generated stubs</title>
<simpara>In <literal>1.1.x</literal> we have introduced a change to the structure of generated stubs. If you have
been using the  <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal> notation to use the stubs from the classpath,
it no longer works. The following example shows how the <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal> notation
used to work:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@AutoConfigureWireMock(stubs = "classpath:/customer-stubs/mappings", port = 8084)</programlisting>
<simpara>You must either change the location of the stubs to:
<literal>classpath:&#8230;&#8203;/META-INF/groupId/artifactId/version/mappings</literal> or use the new
classpath-based <literal>@AutoConfigureStubRunner</literal>, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@AutoConfigureWireMock(stubs = "classpath:customer-stubs/META-INF/travel.components/customer-contract/1.0.2-SNAPSHOT/mappings/", port = 8084)</programlisting>
<simpara>If you do not want to use <literal>@AutoConfigureStubRunner</literal> and you want to remain with the old
structure, set your plugin tasks accordingly. The following example would work for the
structure presented in the previous snippet.</simpara>

Pick 3 keys and unseal Vault. Store the Vault token in the <literal>VAULT_TOKEN</literal>

<simpara>Spring Cloud Vault accesses different resources. By default, the secret
backend is enabled which accesses secret config settings via JSON endpoints.</simpara>
<simpara>The HTTP service has resources in the form:</simpara>
<screen>/secret/{application}/{profile}
/secret/{application}
/secret/{defaultContext}/{profile}
/secret/{defaultContext}</screen>
<simpara>where the "application" is injected as the <literal>spring.application.name</literal> in the
<literal>SpringApplication</literal> (i.e. what is normally "application" in a regular
Spring Boot app), "profile" is an active profile (or comma-separated
list of properties). Properties retrieved from Vault will be used "as-is"
without further prefixing of the property names.</simpara>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_client_side_usage_2">
<title>Client Side Usage</title>
<simpara>To use these features in an application, just build it as a Spring
Boot application that depends on <literal>spring-cloud-vault-config</literal> (e.g. see
the test cases). Example Maven configuration:</simpara>
<example>
<title>pom.xml</title>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;parent&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-parent&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.0.0.RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;relativePath /&gt; &lt;!-- lookup parent from repository --&gt;
&lt;/parent&gt;

&lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-starter-vault-config&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;{project-version}&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-test&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;/dependencies&gt;

&lt;build&gt;
    &lt;plugins&gt;
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;/plugin&gt;
    &lt;/plugins&gt;
&lt;/build&gt;

&lt;!-- repositories also needed for snapshots and milestones --&gt;</programlisting>
</example>
<simpara>Then you can create a standard Spring Boot application, like this simple HTTP server:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class Application {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<simpara>When it runs it will pick up the external configuration from the
default local Vault server on port <literal>8200</literal> if it is running. To modify
the startup behavior you can change the location of the Vault server
using <literal>bootstrap.properties</literal> (like <literal>application.properties</literal> but for
the bootstrap phase of an application context), e.g.</simpara>
<example>
<title>bootstrap.yml</title>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.cloud.vault:
    host: localhost
    port: 8200
    scheme: https
    uri: https://localhost:8200
    connection-timeout: 5000
    read-timeout: 15000
    config:
        order: -10</programlisting>

<simpara>Enabling further integrations requires additional dependencies and

<simpara>If the application imports the <literal>spring-boot-starter-actuator</literal> project, the

<title>AppId authentication</title>
<simpara>Vault supports <link xl:href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/app-id.html">AppId</link>
authentication that consists of two hard to guess tokens. The AppId
defaults to <literal>spring.application.name</literal> that is statically configured.
The second token is the UserId which is a part determined by the application,
usually related to the runtime environment. IP address, Mac address or a
Docker container name are good examples. Spring Cloud Vault Config supports
IP address, Mac address and static UserId&#8217;s (e.g. supplied via System properties).
The IP and Mac address are represented as Hex-encoded SHA256 hash.</simpara>
<simpara>IP address-based UserId&#8217;s use the local host&#8217;s IP address.</simpara>

<title>AWS-EC2 authentication</title>
<simpara>The <link xl:href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws-ec2.html">aws-ec2</link>
auth backend provides a secure introduction mechanism
for AWS EC2 instances, allowing automated retrieval of a Vault
token. Unlike most Vault authentication backends, this backend
does not require first-deploying, or provisioning security-sensitive
credentials (tokens, username/password, client certificates, etc.).
Instead, it treats AWS as a Trusted Third Party and uses the
cryptographically signed dynamic metadata information that uniquely
represents each EC2 instance.</simpara>
<example>
<title>bootstrap.yml using AWS-EC2 Authentication</title>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.cloud.vault:
    authentication: AWS_EC2</programlisting>
</example>
<simpara>AWS-EC2 authentication enables nonce by default to follow
the Trust On First Use (TOFU) principle. Any unintended party that
gains access to the PKCS#7 identity metadata can authenticate
against Vault.</simpara>
<simpara>During the first login, Spring Cloud Vault generates a nonce
that is stored in the auth backend aside the instance Id.
Re-authentication requires the same nonce to be sent. Any other
party does not have the nonce and can raise an alert in Vault for
further investigation.</simpara>
<simpara>The nonce is kept in memory and is lost during application restart.
You can configure a static nonce with <literal>spring.cloud.vault.aws-ec2.nonce</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>AWS-EC2 authentication roles are optional and default to the AMI.
You can configure the authentication role by setting the
<literal>spring.cloud.vault.aws-ec2.role</literal> property.</simpara>

<title>AWS-IAM authentication</title>
<simpara>The <link xl:href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws-ec2.html">aws</link> backend provides a secure
authentication mechanism for AWS IAM roles, allowing the automatic authentication with
vault based on the current IAM role of the running application.
 Unlike most Vault authentication backends, this backend
does not require first-deploying, or provisioning security-sensitive
credentials (tokens, username/password, client certificates, etc.).
Instead, it treats AWS as a Trusted Third Party and uses the
4 pieces of information signed by the caller with their IAM credentials
 to verify that the caller is indeed using that IAM role.</simpara>
<simpara>The current IAM role the application is running in is automatically calculated.
If you are running your application on AWS ECS then the application
will use the IAM role assigned to the ECS task of the running container.
If you are running your application naked on top of an EC2 instance then
the IAM role used will be the one assigned to the EC2 instance.</simpara>
<simpara>When using the AWS-IAM authentication you must create a role in Vault
and assign it to your IAM role. An empty <literal>role</literal> defaults to
the friendly name the current IAM role.</simpara>

<title>Database backends</title>
<simpara>Vault supports several database secret backends to generate database
credentials dynamically based on configured roles. This means
services that need to access a database no longer need to configure
credentials: they can request them from Vault, and use Vault&#8217;s leasing
mechanism to more easily roll keys.</simpara>

<title>Configure <literal>PropertySourceLocator</literal> behavior</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Vault uses property-based configuration to create <literal>PropertySource</literal>s
for generic and discovered secret backends.</simpara>
<simpara>Discovered backends provide <literal>VaultSecretBackendDescriptor</literal> beans to describe the configuration
state to use secret backend as <literal>PropertySource</literal>. A <literal>SecretBackendMetadataFactory</literal> is required
to create a <literal>SecretBackendMetadata</literal> object which contains path, name and property transformation
configuration.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>SecretBackendMetadata</literal> is used to back a particular <literal>PropertySource</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>You can register an arbitrary number of beans implementing <literal>VaultConfigurer</literal> for customization.
Default generic and discovered backend registration is disabled if Spring Cloud Vault discovers
at least one <literal>VaultConfigurer</literal> bean. You can however enable default registration with
<literal>SecretBackendConfigurer.registerDefaultGenericSecretBackends()</literal> and <literal>SecretBackendConfigurer.registerDefaultDiscoveredSecretBackends()</literal>.</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public class CustomizationBean implements VaultConfigurer {

    @Override
    public void addSecretBackends(SecretBackendConfigurer configurer) {

        configurer.add("secret/my-application");

        configurer.registerDefaultGenericSecretBackends(false);
        configurer.registerDefaultDiscoveredSecretBackends(true);
    }
}</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<note>
<simpara>All customization is required to happen in the bootstrap context. Add your configuration
classes to <literal>META-INF/spring.factories</literal> at <literal>org.springframework.cloud.bootstrap.BootstrapConfiguration</literal>
in your application.</simpara>
</note>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_service_registry_configuration">
<title>Service Registry Configuration</title>
<simpara>You can use a <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> (such as from Spring Cloud Consul) to locate
a Vault server by setting spring.cloud.vault.discovery.enabled=true (default <literal>false</literal>).
The net result of that is that your apps need a bootstrap.yml (or an environment variable)
with the appropriate discovery configuration.
The benefit is that the Vault can change its co-ordinates, as long as the discovery service
is a fixed point. The default service id is <literal>vault</literal> but you can change that on the client with
<literal>spring.cloud.vault.discovery.serviceId</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>The discovery client implementations all support some kind of metadata map
(e.g. for Eureka we have eureka.instance.metadataMap). Some additional properties of the service
may need to be configured in its service registration metadata so that clients can connect
correctly. Service registries that do not provide details about transport layer security
need to provide a <literal>scheme</literal> metadata entry to be set either to <literal>https</literal> or <literal>http</literal>.
If no scheme is configured and the service is not exposed as secure service, then
configuration defaults to <literal>spring.cloud.vault.scheme</literal> which is <literal>https</literal> when it&#8217;s not set.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="vault-lease-renewal">
<title>Lease lifecycle management (renewal and revocation)</title>
<simpara>With every secret, Vault creates a lease:
metadata containing information such as a time duration,
renewability, and more.</simpara>
<simpara>Vault promises that the data will be valid for the given duration,
or Time To Live (TTL). Once the lease is expired, Vault can
revoke the data, and the consumer of the secret can no longer
be certain that it is valid.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Vault maintains a lease lifecycle beyond
the creation of login tokens and secrets. That said,
login tokens and secrets associated with a lease
are scheduled for renewal just before the lease expires
until terminal expiry.
Application shutdown revokes obtained login tokens and renewable
leases.</simpara>
<simpara>Secret service and database backends (such as MongoDB or MySQL)
usually generate a renewable lease so generated credentials will
be disabled on application shutdown.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Static tokens are not renewed or revoked.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Lease renewal and revocation is enabled by default and can
be disabled by setting <literal>spring.cloud.vault.config.lifecycle.enabled</literal>
to <literal>false</literal>. This is not recommended as leases can expire and
Spring Cloud Vault cannot longer access Vault or services
using generated credentials and valid credentials remain active
after application shutdown.</simpara>

<simpara>Spring Cloud Gateway is built upon <link xl:href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#learn">Spring Boot 2.x</link>,
<link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html">Spring WebFlux</link>,
and <link xl:href="https://projectreactor.io/docs">Project Reactor</link>.  As a consequence
many of the familiar synchronous libraries (Spring Data and Spring Security, for example) and patterns you may
not apply when using Spring Cloud Gateway.  If you are unfamiliar with these projects we suggest you
begin by reading their documentation to familiarize yourself with some of the new concepts before
working with Spring Cloud Gateway.</simpara>

<simpara>Spring Cloud Gateway requires the Netty runtime provided by Spring Boot and Spring Webflux. It does not work in a traditional Servlet Container or built as a WAR.</simpara>

<simpara>Clients make requests to Spring Cloud Gateway. If the Gateway Handler Mapping determines that a request matches a Route, it is sent to the Gateway Web Handler. This handler runs sends the request through a filter chain that is specific to the request. The reason the filters are divided by the dotted line, is that filters may execute logic before the proxy request is sent or after. All "pre" filter logic is executed, then the proxy request is made. After the proxy request is made, the "post" filter logic is executed.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>URIs defined in routes without a port will get a default port set to 80 and 443 for HTTP and HTTPS URIs respectively.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_modifying_the_way_remote_addresses_are_resolved">
<title>Modifying the way remote addresses are resolved</title>
<simpara>By default the RemoteAddr Route Predicate Factory uses the remote address from the incoming request.
This may not match the actual client IP address if Spring Cloud Gateway sits behind a proxy layer.</simpara>
<simpara>You can customize the way that the remote address is resolved by setting a custom <literal>RemoteAddressResolver</literal>.
Spring Cloud Gateway comes with one non-default remote address resolver which is based off of the <link xl:href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For">X-Forwarded-For header</link>, <literal>XForwardedRemoteAddressResolver</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>XForwardedRemoteAddressResolver</literal> has two static constructor methods which take different approaches to security:</simpara>
<simpara><literal>XForwardedRemoteAddressResolver::trustAll</literal> returns a <literal>RemoteAddressResolver</literal> which always takes the first IP address found in the <literal>X-Forwarded-For</literal> header.
This approach is vulnerable to spoofing, as a malicious client could set an initial value for the <literal>X-Forwarded-For</literal> which would be accepted by the resolver.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>XForwardedRemoteAddressResolver::maxTrustedIndex</literal> takes an index which correlates to the number of trusted infrastructure running in front of Spring Cloud Gateway.
If Spring Cloud Gateway is, for example only accessible via HAProxy, then a value of 1 should be used.
If two hops of trusted infrastructure are required before Spring Cloud Gateway is accessible, then a value of 2 should be used.</simpara>
<simpara>Given the following header value:</simpara>
<screen>X-Forwarded-For: 0.0.0.1, 0.0.0.2, 0.0.0.3</screen>

<simpara>This will forward to the <literal>/incaseoffailureusethis</literal> URI when the Hystrix fallback is called. Note that this example also demonstrates (optional) Spring Cloud Netflix Ribbon load-balancing via the <literal>lb</literal> prefix on the destination URI.</simpara>
<simpara>The primary scenario is to use the <literal>fallbackUri</literal> to an internal controller or handler within the gateway app.
However, it is also possible to reroute the request to a controller or handler in an external application, like so:</simpara>

<simpara>For the external controller/ handler scenario, headers can be added with exception details. You can find more information

<simpara>The algorithm used is the <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket">Token Bucket Algorithm</link>.</simpara>

<title>TLS / SSL</title>
<simpara>The Gateway can listen for requests on https by following the usual Spring server configuration. Example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">server:
  ssl:
    enabled: true
    key-alias: scg
    key-store-password: scg1234
    key-store: classpath:scg-keystore.p12
    key-store-type: PKCS12</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Gateway routes can be routed to both http and https backends. If routing to a https backend then the Gateway can be configured to trust all downstream certificates with the following configuration:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      httpclient:
        ssl:
          useInsecureTrustManager: true</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Using an insecure trust manager is not suitable for production. For a production deployment the Gateway can be configured with a set of known certificates that it can trust with the follwing configuration:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:

          trustedX509Certificates:
          - cert1.pem
          - cert2.pem</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>If the Spring Cloud Gateway is not provisioned with trusted certificates the default trust store is used (which can be overriden with system property javax.net.ssl.trustStore).</simpara>
<section xml:id="_tls_handshake">
<title>TLS Handshake</title>
<simpara>The Gateway maintains a client pool that it uses to route to backends. When communicating over https the client initiates a TLS handshake. A number of timeouts are assoicated with this handshake. These timeouts can be configured (defaults shown):</simpara>

<title>Configuration</title>
<simpara>Configuration for Spring Cloud Gateway is driven by a collection of `RouteDefinitionLocator`s.</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>RouteDefinitionLocator.java</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface RouteDefinitionLocator {
	Flux&lt;RouteDefinition&gt; getRouteDefinitions();
}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>By default, a <literal>PropertiesRouteDefinitionLocator</literal> loads properties using Spring Boot&#8217;s <literal>@ConfigurationProperties</literal> mechanism.</simpara>
<simpara>The configuration examples above all use a shortcut notation that uses positional arguments rather than named ones. The two examples below are equivalent:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:

          args:
            status: 401
      - id: setstatusshortcut_route
        uri: https://example.org
        filters:
        - SetStatus=401</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>For some usages of the gateway, properties will be adequate, but some production use cases will benefit from loading configuration from an external source, such as a database. Future milestone versions will have <literal>RouteDefinitionLocator</literal> implementations based off of Spring Data Repositories such as: Redis, MongoDB and Cassandra.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_fluent_java_routes_api">
<title>Fluent Java Routes API</title>
<simpara>To allow for simple configuration in Java, there is a fluent API defined in the <literal>RouteLocatorBuilder</literal> bean.</simpara>

<simpara>This style also allows for more custom predicate assertions. The predicates defined by <literal>RouteDefinitionLocator</literal> beans are combined using logical <literal>and</literal>. By using the fluent Java API, you can use the <literal>and()</literal>, <literal>or()</literal> and <literal>negate()</literal> operators on the <literal>Predicate</literal> class.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_discoveryclient_route_definition_locator">
<title>DiscoveryClient Route Definition Locator</title>
<simpara>The Gateway can be configured to create routes based on services registered with a <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> compatible service registry.</simpara>
<simpara>To enable this, set <literal>spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.enabled=true</literal> and make sure a <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> implementation is on the classpath and enabled (such as Netflix Eureka, Consul or Zookeeper).</simpara>
<section xml:id="_configuring_predicates_and_filters_for_discoveryclient_routes">
<title>Configuring Predicates and Filters For DiscoveryClient Routes</title>
<simpara>By default the Gateway defines a single predicate and filter for routes created via a <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>The default predicate is a path predicate defined with the pattern <literal>/serviceId/**</literal>, where <literal>serviceId</literal> is
the id of the service from the <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>The default filter is rewrite path filter with the regex <literal>/serviceId/(?&lt;remaining&gt;.*)</literal> and the replacement
<literal>/${remaining}</literal>.  This just strips the service id from the path before the request is sent
downstream.</simpara>
<simpara>If you would like to customize the predicates and/or filters used by the <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> routes you can do so
by setting <literal>spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.predicates[x]</literal> and <literal>spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.filters[y]</literal>.
When doing so you need to make sure to include the default predicate and filter above, if you want to retain
that functionality.  Below is an example of what this looks like.</simpara>

<simpara>In the example above, CORS requests will be allowed from requests that originate from docs.spring.io for all GET requested paths.</simpara>
<simpara>To provide the same CORS configuration to requests that are not handled by some gateway route predicate, set the property <literal>spring.cloud.gateway.globalcors.add-to-simple-url-handler-mapping</literal> equal to true.

<title>Building a Simple Gateway Using Spring MVC or Webflux</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Gateway provides a utility object called <literal>ProxyExchange</literal> which you can use inside a regular Spring web handler as a method parameter. It supports basic downstream HTTP exchanges via methods that mirror the HTTP verbs. With MVC it also supports forwarding to a local handler via the <literal>forward()</literal> method. To use the <literal>ProxyExchange</literal> just include the right module in your classpath (either <literal>spring-cloud-gateway-mvc</literal> or <literal>spring-cloud-gateway-webflux</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>MVC example (proxying a request to "/test" downstream to a remote server):</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RestController
@SpringBootApplication
public class GatewaySampleApplication {

	@Value("${remote.home}")
	private URI home;

	@GetMapping("/test")
	public ResponseEntity&lt;?&gt; proxy(ProxyExchange&lt;byte[]&gt; proxy) throws Exception {
		return proxy.uri(home.toString() + "/image/png").get();
	}

}</programlisting>
<simpara>The same thing with Webflux:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RestController
@SpringBootApplication
public class GatewaySampleApplication {

	@Value("${remote.home}")
	private URI home;

	@GetMapping("/test")
	public Mono&lt;ResponseEntity&lt;?&gt;&gt; proxy(ProxyExchange&lt;byte[]&gt; proxy) throws Exception {
		return proxy.uri(home.toString() + "/image/png").get();
	}

}</programlisting>
<simpara>There are convenience methods on the <literal>ProxyExchange</literal> to enable the handler method to discover and enhance the URI path of the incoming request. For example you might want to extract the trailing elements of a path to pass them downstream:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@GetMapping("/proxy/path/**")
public ResponseEntity&lt;?&gt; proxyPath(ProxyExchange&lt;byte[]&gt; proxy) throws Exception {
  String path = proxy.path("/proxy/path/");
  return proxy.uri(home.toString() + "/foos/" + path).get();
}</programlisting>
<simpara>All the features of Spring MVC or Webflux are available to Gateway handler methods. So you can inject request headers and query parameters, for instance, and you can constrain the incoming requests with declarations in the mapping annotation. See the documentation for <literal>@RequestMapping</literal> in Spring MVC for more details of those features.</simpara>
<simpara>Headers can be added to the downstream response using the <literal>header()</literal> methods on <literal>ProxyExchange</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>You can also manipulate response headers (and anything else you like in the response) by adding a mapper to the <literal>get()</literal> etc. method. The mapper is a <literal>Function</literal> that takes the incoming <literal>ResponseEntity</literal> and converts it to an outgoing one.</simpara>
<simpara>First class support is provided for "sensitive" headers ("cookie" and "authorization" by default) which are not passed downstream, and for "proxy" headers (<literal>x-forwarded-*</literal>).</simpara>

<title>Introduction</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Function is a project with the following high-level goals:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Promote the implementation of business logic via functions.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Decouple the development lifecycle of business logic from any specific runtime target so that the same code can run as a web endpoint, a stream processor, or a task.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Support a uniform programming model across serverless providers, as well as the ability to run standalone (locally or in a PaaS).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Enable Spring Boot features (auto-configuration, dependency injection, metrics) on serverless providers.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>It abstracts away all of the transport details and
infrastructure, allowing the developer to keep all the familiar tools
and processes, and focus firmly on business logic.</simpara>
<simpara>Here&#8217;s a complete, executable, testable Spring Boot application
(implementing a simple string manipulation):</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

  @Bean
  public Function&lt;Flux&lt;String&gt;, Flux&lt;String&gt;&gt; uppercase() {
    return flux -&gt; flux.map(value -&gt; value.toUpperCase());
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>It&#8217;s just a Spring Boot application, so it can be built, run and
tested, locally and in a CI build, the same way as any other Spring
Boot application. The <literal>Function</literal> is from <literal>java.util</literal> and <literal>Flux</literal> is a
<link xl:href="https://www.reactive-streams.org/">Reactive Streams</link> <literal>Publisher</literal> from
<link xl:href="https://projectreactor.io/">Project Reactor</link>. The function can be
accessed over HTTP or messaging.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Function has 4 main features:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>Wrappers for <literal>@Beans</literal> of type <literal>Function</literal>, <literal>Consumer</literal> and
<literal>Supplier</literal>, exposing them to the outside world as either HTTP
endpoints and/or message stream listeners/publishers with RabbitMQ, Kafka etc.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Compiling strings which are Java function bodies into bytecode, and
then turning them into <literal>@Beans</literal> that can be wrapped as above.</simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara>Deploying a JAR file containing such an application context with an
isolated classloader, so that you can pack them together in a single

<title>Getting Started</title>
<simpara>Build from the command line (and "install" the samples):</simpara>
<screen>$ ./mvnw clean install</screen>
<simpara>(If you like to YOLO add <literal>-DskipTests</literal>.)</simpara>
<simpara>Run one of the samples, e.g.</simpara>
<screen>$ java -jar spring-cloud-function-samples/function-sample/target/*.jar</screen>
<simpara>This runs the app and exposes its functions over HTTP, so you can
convert a string to uppercase, like this:</simpara>
<screen>$ curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" localhost:8080/uppercase -d Hello
HELLO</screen>
<simpara>You can convert multiple strings (a <literal>Flux&lt;String&gt;</literal>) by separating them
with new lines</simpara>
<screen>$ curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" localhost:8080/uppercase -d 'Hello
&gt; World'
HELLOWORLD</screen>
<simpara>(You can use <literal><superscript>Q</superscript>J</literal> in a terminal to insert a new line in a literal
string like that.)</simpara>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_building_and_running_a_function">
<title>Building and Running a Function</title>
<simpara>The sample <literal>@SpringBootApplication</literal> above has a function that can be
decorated at runtime by Spring Cloud Function to be an HTTP endpoint,
or a Stream processor, for instance with RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka or
JMS.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>@Beans</literal> can be <literal>Function</literal>, <literal>Consumer</literal> or <literal>Supplier</literal> (all from
<literal>java.util</literal>), and their parametric types can be String or POJO.</simpara>
<simpara>Functions can also be of <literal>Flux&lt;String&gt;</literal> or <literal>Flux&lt;Pojo&gt;</literal> and Spring
Cloud Function takes care of converting the data to and from the
desired types, as long as it comes in as plain text or (in the case of
the POJO) JSON. There is also support for <literal>Message&lt;Pojo&gt;</literal> where the
message headers are copied from the incoming event, depending on the
adapter. The web adapter also supports conversion from form-encoded
data to a <literal>Map</literal>, and if you are using the function with Spring Cloud
Stream then all the conversion and coercion features for message
payloads will be applicable as well.</simpara>
<simpara>Functions can be grouped together in a single application, or deployed
one-per-jar. It&#8217;s up to the developer to choose. An app with multiple
functions can be deployed multiple times in different "personalities",
exposing different functions over different physical transports.</simpara>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_function_catalog_and_flexible_function_signatures">
<title>Function Catalog and Flexible Function Signatures</title>
<simpara>One of the main features of Spring Cloud Function is to adapt and support a range of type signatures for user-defined functions,
while providing a consistent execution model.
That&#8217;s why all user defined functions are transformed into a canonical representation by <literal>FunctionCatalog</literal>, using primitives
defined by the <link xl:href="https://projectreactor.io/">Project Reactor</link> (i.e., <literal>Flux&lt;T&gt;</literal> and <literal>Mono&lt;T&gt;</literal>).
Users can supply a bean of type <literal>Function&lt;String,String&gt;</literal>, for instance, and the <literal>FunctionCatalog</literal> will wrap it into a
<literal>Function&lt;Flux&lt;String&gt;,Flux&lt;String&gt;&gt;</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Using Reactor based primitives not only helps with the canonical representation of user defined functions, but it also
facilitates a more robust and flexible(reactive) execution model.</simpara>
<simpara>While users don&#8217;t normally have to care about the <literal>FunctionCatalog</literal> at all, it is useful to know what
kind of functions are supported in user code.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_java_8_function_support">
<title>Java 8 function support</title>
<simpara>Generally speaking users can expect that if they write a function for
a plain old Java type (or primitive wrapper), then the function
catalog will wrap it to a <literal>Flux</literal> of the same type. If the user writes
a function using <literal>Message</literal> (from spring-messaging) it will receive and
transmit headers from any adapter that supports key-value metadata
(e.g. HTTP headers). Here are the details.</simpara>

<simpara>Consumer is a little bit special because it has a <literal>void</literal> return type,
which implies blocking, at least potentially. Most likely you will not
need to write <literal>Consumer&lt;Flux&lt;?&gt;&gt;</literal>, but if you do need to do that,
remember to subscribe to the input flux. If you declare a <literal>Consumer</literal>
of a non publisher type (which is normal), it will be converted to a
function that returns a publisher, so that it can be subscribed to in
a controlled way.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_kotlin_lambda_support">
<title>Kotlin Lambda support</title>
<simpara>We also provide support for Kotlin lambdas (since v2.0).
Consider the following:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
open fun kotlinSupplier(): () -&gt; String {
    return  { "Hello from Kotlin" }
}

@Bean
open fun kotlinFunction(): (String) -&gt; String {
    return  { it.toUpperCase() }
}

@Bean
open fun kotlinConsumer(): (String) -&gt; Unit {
    return  { println(it) }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The above represents Kotlin lambdas configured as Spring beans. The signature of each maps to a Java equivalent of
<literal>Supplier</literal>, <literal>Function</literal> and <literal>Consumer</literal>, and thus supported/recognized signatures by the framework.
While mechanics of Kotlin-to-Java mapping are outside of the scope of this documentation, it is important to understand that the
same rules for signature transformation outlined in "Java 8 function support" section are applied here as well.</simpara>
<simpara>To enable Kotlin support all you need is to add <literal>spring-cloud-function-kotlin</literal> module to your classpath which contains the appropriate
autoconfiguration and supporting classes.</simpara>

<simpara>As the table above shows the behaviour of the endpoint depends on the method and also the type of incoming request data. When the incoming data is single valued, and the target function is declared as obviously single valued (i.e. not returning a collection or <literal>Flux</literal>), then the response will also contain a single value.
For multi-valued responses the client can ask for a server-sent event stream by sending `Accept: text/event-stream".</simpara>
<simpara>If there is only a single function (consumer etc.) in the catalog, the name in the path is optional.
Composite functions can be addressed using pipes or commas to separate function names (pipes are legal in URL paths, but a bit awkward to type on the command line).</simpara>
<simpara>For cases where there is more then a single function in catalog and you want to map a specific function to the root
path (e.g., "/"), or you want to compose several functions and then map to the root path you can do so by providing
<literal>spring.cloud.function.definition</literal> property which essentially used by spring-=cloud-function-web module to provide
default mapping for cases where there is some type of a conflict (e.g., more then one function available etc).</simpara>
<simpara>For example,</simpara>
<screen>--spring.cloud.function.definition=foo|bar</screen>
<simpara>The above property will compose 'foo' and 'bar' function and map the composed function to the "/" path.</simpara>
<simpara>Functions and consumers that are declared with input and output in <literal>Message&lt;?&gt;</literal> will see the request headers on the input messages, and the output message headers will be converted to HTTP headers.</simpara>
<simpara>When POSTing text the response format might be different with Spring Boot 2.0 and older versions, depending on the content negotiation (provide content type and accpt headers for the best results).</simpara>

<simpara>To send or receive messages from a broker (such as RabbitMQ or Kafka) you can leverage <literal>spring-cloud-stream</literal> project and it&#8217;s integration with Spring Cloud Function.

<chapter xml:id="_deploying_a_packaged_function">
<title>Deploying a Packaged Function</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Function provides a "deployer" library that allows you to launch a jar file (or exploded archive, or set of jar files) with an isolated class loader and expose the functions defined in it. This is quite a powerful tool that would allow you to, for instance, adapt a function to a range of different input-output adapters without changing the target jar file. Serverless platforms often have this kind of feature built in, so you could see it as a building block for a function invoker in such a platform (indeed the <link xl:href="https://projectriff.io">Riff</link> Java function invoker uses this library).</simpara>
<simpara>The standard entry point of the API is the Spring configuration annotation <literal>@EnableFunctionDeployer</literal>. If that is used in a Spring Boot application the deployer kicks in and looks for some configuration to tell it where to find the function jar. At a minimum the user has to provide a <literal>function.location</literal> which is a URL or resource location for the archive containing the functions. It can optionally use a <literal>maven:</literal> prefix to locate the artifact via a dependency lookup (see <literal>FunctionProperties</literal> for complete details). A Spring Boot application is bootstrapped from the jar file, using the <literal>MANIFEST.MF</literal> to locate a start class, so that a standard Spring Boot fat jar works well, for example. If the target jar can be launched successfully then the result is a function registered in the main application&#8217;s <literal>FunctionCatalog</literal>. The registered function can be applied by code in the main application, even though it was created in an isolated class loader (by deault).</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_functional_bean_definitions">
<title>Functional Bean Definitions</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Function supports a "functional" style of bean declarations for small apps where you need fast startup. The functional style of bean declaration was a feature of Spring Framework 5.0 with significant enhancements in 5.1.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_comparing_functional_with_traditional_bean_definitions">
<title>Comparing Functional with Traditional Bean Definitions</title>
<simpara>Here&#8217;s a vanilla Spring Cloud Function application from with the
familiar <literal>@Configuration</literal> and <literal>@Bean</literal> declaration style:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {

  @Bean
  public Function&lt;String, String&gt; uppercase() {
    return value -&gt; value.toUpperCase();
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
  }

}</programlisting>
<simpara>You can run the above in a serverless platform, like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions, or you can run it in its own HTTP server just by including <literal>spring-cloud-function-starter-web</literal> on the classpath. Running the main method would expose an endpoint that you can use to ping that <literal>uppercase</literal> function:</simpara>
<screen>$ curl localhost:8080 -d foo
FOO</screen>
<simpara>The web adapter in <literal>spring-cloud-function-starter-web</literal> uses Spring MVC, so you needed a Servlet container. You can also use Webflux where the default server is netty (even though you can still use Servlet containers if you want to) - just include the <literal>spring-cloud-starter-function-webflux</literal> dependency instead. The functionality is the same, and the user application code can be used in both.</simpara>
<simpara>Now for the functional beans: the user application code can be recast into "functional"
form, like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootConfiguration
public class DemoApplication implements ApplicationContextInitializer&lt;GenericApplicationContext&gt; {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    FunctionalSpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
  }

  public Function&lt;String, String&gt; uppercase() {
    return value -&gt; value.toUpperCase();
  }

  @Override
  public void initialize(GenericApplicationContext context) {
    context.registerBean("demo", FunctionRegistration.class,
        () -&gt; new FunctionRegistration&lt;&gt;(uppercase())
            .type(FunctionType.from(String.class).to(String.class)));
  }

}</programlisting>
<simpara>The main differences are:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>The main class is an <literal>ApplicationContextInitializer</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The <literal>@Bean</literal> methods have been converted to calls to <literal>context.registerBean()</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The <literal>@SpringBootApplication</literal> has been replaced with
<literal>@SpringBootConfiguration</literal> to signify that we are not enabling Spring
Boot autoconfiguration, and yet still marking the class as an "entry
point".</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The <literal>SpringApplication</literal> from Spring Boot has been replaced with a
<literal>FunctionalSpringApplication</literal> from Spring Cloud Function (it&#8217;s a
subclass).</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The business logic beans that you register in a Spring Cloud Function app are of type <literal>FunctionRegistration</literal>. This is a wrapper that contains both the function and information about the input and output types. In the <literal>@Bean</literal> form of the application that information can be derived reflectively, but in a functional bean registration some of it is lost unless we use a <literal>FunctionRegistration</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>An alternative to using an <literal>ApplicationContextInitializer</literal> and <literal>FunctionRegistration</literal> is to make the application itself implement <literal>Function</literal> (or <literal>Consumer</literal> or <literal>Supplier</literal>). Example (equivalent to the above):</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootConfiguration
public class DemoApplication implements Function&lt;String, String&gt; {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    FunctionalSpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
  }

  @Override
  public String uppercase(String value) {
    return value.toUpperCase();
  }

}</programlisting>
<simpara>It would also work if you add a separate, standalone class of type <literal>Function</literal> and register it with the <literal>SpringApplication</literal> using an alternative form of the <literal>run()</literal> method. The main thing is that the generic type information is available at runtime through the class declaration.</simpara>
<simpara>The app runs in its own HTTP server if you add <literal>spring-cloud-starter-function-webflux</literal> (it won&#8217;t work with the MVC starter at the moment because the functional form of the embedded Servlet container hasn&#8217;t been implemented).  The app also runs just fine in AWS Lambda or Azure Functions, and the improvements in startup time are dramatic.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The "lite" web server has some limitations for the range of <literal>Function</literal> signatures - in particular it doesn&#8217;t (yet) support <literal>Message</literal> input and output, but POJOs and any kind of <literal>Publisher</literal> should be fine.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_testing_functional_applications">
<title>Testing Functional Applications</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Function also has some utilities for integration testing that will be very familiar to Spring Boot users. For example, here is an integration test for the HTTP server wrapping the app above:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@FunctionalSpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureWebTestClient
public class FunctionalTests {

	@Autowired
	private WebTestClient client;

	@Test
	public void words() throws Exception {
		client.post().uri("/").body(Mono.just("foo"), String.class).exchange()
				.expectStatus().isOk().expectBody(String.class).isEqualTo("FOO");
	}

}</programlisting>
<simpara>This test is almost identical to the one you would write for the <literal>@Bean</literal> version of the same app - the only difference is the <literal>@FunctionalSpringBootTest</literal> annotation, instead of the regular <literal>@SpringBootTest</literal>. All the other pieces, like the <literal>@Autowired</literal> <literal>WebTestClient</literal>, are standard Spring Boot features.</simpara>
<simpara>Or you could write a test for a non-HTTP app using just the <literal>FunctionCatalog</literal>. For example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@FunctionalSpringBootTest
public class FunctionalTests {

	@Autowired
	private FunctionCatalog catalog;

	@Test
	public void words() throws Exception {
		Function&lt;Flux&lt;String&gt;, Flux&lt;String&gt;&gt; function = catalog.lookup(Function.class,
				"function");
		assertThat(function.apply(Flux.just("foo")).blockFirst()).isEqualTo("FOO");
	}

}</programlisting>
<simpara>(The <literal>FunctionCatalog</literal> always returns functions from <literal>Flux</literal> to <literal>Flux</literal>, even if the user declares them with a simpler signature.)</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_limitations_of_functional_bean_declaration">
<title>Limitations of Functional Bean Declaration</title>
<simpara>Most Spring Cloud Function apps have a relatively small scope compared to the whole of Spring Boot, so we are able to adapt it to these functional bean definitions easily. If you step outside that limited scope, you can extend your Spring Cloud Function app by switching back to <literal>@Bean</literal> style configuration, or by using a hybrid approach. If you want to take advantage of Spring Boot autoconfiguration for integrations with external datastores, for example, you will need to use <literal>@EnableAutoConfiguration</literal>. Your functions can still be defined using the functional declarations if you want (i.e. the "hybrid" style), but in that case you will need to explicitly switch off the "full functional mode" using <literal>spring.functional.enabled=false</literal> so that Spring Boot can take back control.</simpara>

<title>Serverless Platform Adapters</title>
<simpara>As well as being able to run as a standalone process, a Spring Cloud
Function application can be adapted to run one of the existing
serverless platforms. In the project there are adapters for
<link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-function/tree/master/spring-cloud-function-adapters/spring-cloud-function-adapter-aws">AWS

and

has its own Spring Cloud Function adapter. And

<section xml:id="_aws_lambda">
<title>AWS Lambda</title>
<simpara>The <link xl:href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</link> adapter takes a Spring Cloud Function app and converts it to a form that can run in AWS Lambda.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_introduction_3">
<title>Introduction</title>
<simpara>The adapter has a couple of generic request handlers that you can use. The most generic is <literal>SpringBootStreamHandler</literal>, which uses a Jackson <literal>ObjectMapper</literal> provided by Spring Boot to serialize and deserialize the objects in the function. There is also a <literal>SpringBootRequestHandler</literal> which you can extend, and provide the input and output types as type parameters (enabling AWS to inspect the class and do the JSON conversions itself).</simpara>
<simpara>If your app has more than one <literal>@Bean</literal> of type <literal>Function</literal> etc. then you can choose the one to use by configuring <literal>function.name</literal> (e.g. as <literal>FUNCTION_NAME</literal> environment variable in AWS). The functions are extracted from the Spring Cloud <literal>FunctionCatalog</literal> (searching first for <literal>Function</literal> then <literal>Consumer</literal> and finally <literal>Supplier</literal>).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_notes_on_jar_layout">
<title>Notes on JAR Layout</title>
<simpara>You don&#8217;t need the Spring Cloud Function Web or Stream adapter at runtime in Lambda, so you might need to exclude those before you create the JAR you send to AWS. A Lambda application has to be shaded, but a Spring Boot standalone application does not, so you can run the same app using 2 separate jars (as per the sample). The sample app creates 2 jar files, one with an <literal>aws</literal> classifier for deploying in Lambda, and one executable (thin) jar that includes <literal>spring-cloud-function-web</literal> at runtime. Spring Cloud Function will try and locate a "main class" for you from the JAR file manifest, using the <literal>Start-Class</literal> attribute (which will be added for you by the Spring Boot tooling if you use the starter parent). If there is no <literal>Start-Class</literal> in your manifest you can use an environment variable <literal>MAIN_CLASS</literal> when you deploy the function to AWS.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_upload">
<title>Upload</title>
<simpara>Build the sample under <literal>spring-cloud-function-samples/function-sample-aws</literal> and upload the <literal>-aws</literal> jar file to Lambda. The handler can be <literal>example.Handler</literal> or <literal>org.springframework.cloud.function.adapter.aws.SpringBootStreamHandler</literal> (FQN of the class, <emphasis>not</emphasis> a method reference, although Lambda does accept method references).</simpara>
<screen>./mvnw -U clean package</screen>
<simpara>Using the AWS command line tools it looks like this:</simpara>
<screen>aws lambda create-function --function-name Uppercase --role arn:aws:iam::[USERID]:role/service-role/[ROLE] --zip-file fileb://function-sample-aws/target/function-sample-aws-2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT-aws.jar --handler org.springframework.cloud.function.adapter.aws.SpringBootStreamHandler --description "Spring Cloud Function Adapter Example" --runtime java8 --region us-east-1 --timeout 30 --memory-size 1024 --publish</screen>
<simpara>The input type for the function in the AWS sample is a Foo with a single property called "value". So you would need this to test it:</simpara>
<screen>{
  "value": "test"
}</screen>
<note>
<simpara>The AWS sample app is written in the "functional" style (as an <literal>ApplicationContextInitializer</literal>). This is much faster on startup in Lambda than the traditional <literal>@Bean</literal> style, so if you don&#8217;t need <literal>@Beans</literal> (or <literal>@EnableAutoConfiguration</literal>) it&#8217;s a good choice.

<section xml:id="_http_and_api_gateway">
<title>HTTP and API Gateway</title>
<simpara>AWS has some platform-specific data types, including batching of messages, which is much more efficient than processing each one individually. To make use of these types you can write a function that depends on those types. Or you can rely on Spring to extract the data from the AWS types and convert it to a Spring <literal>Message</literal>. To do this you tell AWS that the function is of a specific generic handler type (depending on the AWS service) and provide a bean of type <literal>Function&lt;Message&lt;S&gt;,Message&lt;T&gt;&gt;</literal>, where <literal>S</literal> and <literal>T</literal> are your business data types. If there is more than one bean of type <literal>Function</literal> you may also need to configure the Spring Boot property <literal>function.name</literal> to be the name of the target bean (e.g. use <literal>FUNCTION_NAME</literal> as an environment variable).</simpara>

<section xml:id="_azure_functions">
<title>Azure Functions</title>
<simpara>The <link xl:href="https://azure.microsoft.com">Azure</link> adapter bootstraps a Spring Cloud Function context and channels function calls from the Azure framework into the user functions, using Spring Boot configuration where necessary. Azure Functions has quite a unique, but invasive programming model, involving annotations in user code that are specific to the platform. The easiest way to use it with Spring Cloud is to extend a base class and write a method in it with the <literal>@FunctionName</literal> annotation which delegates to a base class method.</simpara>
<simpara>This project provides an adapter layer for a Spring Cloud Function application onto Azure.
You can write an app with a single <literal>@Bean</literal> of type <literal>Function</literal> and it will be deployable in Azure if you get the JAR file laid out right.</simpara>
<simpara>There is an <literal>AzureSpringBootRequestHandler</literal> which you must extend, and provide the input and output types as annotated method parameters (enabling Azure to inspect the class and create JSON bindings). The base class has two useful methods (<literal>handleRequest</literal> and <literal>handleOutput</literal>) to which you can delegate the actual function call, so mostly the function will only ever have one line.</simpara>
<simpara>Example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public class FooHandler extends AzureSpringBootRequestHandler&lt;Foo, Bar&gt; {
	@FunctionName("uppercase")
	public Bar execute(
			@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = { HttpMethod.GET,
					HttpMethod.POST }, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
                    Foo foo,
			ExecutionContext context) {
		return handleRequest(foo, context);
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>This Azure handler will delegate to a <literal>Function&lt;Foo,Bar&gt;</literal> bean (or a <literal>Function&lt;Publisher&lt;Foo&gt;,Publisher&lt;Bar&gt;&gt;</literal>). Some Azure triggers (e.g. <literal>@CosmosDBTrigger</literal>) result in a input type of <literal>List</literal> and in that case you can bind to <literal>List</literal> in the Azure handler, or <literal>String</literal> (the raw JSON). The <literal>List</literal> input delegates to a <literal>Function</literal> with input type <literal>Map&lt;String,Object&gt;</literal>, or <literal>Publisher</literal> or <literal>List</literal> of the same type. The output of the <literal>Function</literal> can be a <literal>List</literal> (one-for-one) or a single value (aggregation), and the output binding in the Azure declaration should match.</simpara>
<simpara>If your app has more than one <literal>@Bean</literal> of type <literal>Function</literal> etc. then you can choose the one to use by configuring <literal>function.name</literal>. Or if you make the <literal>@FunctionName</literal> in the Azure handler method match the function name it should work that way (also for function apps with multiple functions). The functions are extracted from the Spring Cloud <literal>FunctionCatalog</literal> so the default function names are the same as the bean names.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_notes_on_jar_layout_2">
<title>Notes on JAR Layout</title>
<simpara>You don&#8217;t need the Spring Cloud Function Web at runtime in Azure, so you can exclude this before you create the JAR you deploy to Azure, but it won&#8217;t be used if you include it so it doesn&#8217;t hurt to leave it in. A function application on Azure is an archive generated by the Maven plugin. The function lives in the JAR file generated by this project. The sample creates it as an executable jar, using the thin layout, so that Azure can find the handler classes. If you prefer you can just use a regular flat JAR file. The dependencies should <emphasis role="strong">not</emphasis> be included.</simpara>

<simpara>and <literal>curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" localhost:8080/function -d '{"value": "hello foobar"}'</literal>.</simpara>

<screen>$ az login

Please ensure that you use the right URL for the function above. Alternatively you can test the function in the Azure Dashboard UI (click on the function name, go to the right hand side and click "Test" and to the bottom right, "Run").</simpara>
<simpara>The input type for the function in the Azure sample is a Foo with a single property called "value". So you need this to test it with something like below:</simpara>
<screen>{
  "value": "foobar"
}</screen>
<note>
<simpara>The Azure sample app is written in the "non-functional" style (using <literal>@Bean</literal>). The functional style (with just <literal>Function</literal> or <literal>ApplicationContextInitializer</literal>) is much faster on startup in Azure than the traditional <literal>@Bean</literal> style, so if you don&#8217;t need <literal>@Beans</literal> (or <literal>@EnableAutoConfiguration</literal>) it&#8217;s a good choice.

<chapter xml:id="_discoveryclient_for_kubernetes">
<title>DiscoveryClient for Kubernetes</title>
<simpara>This project provides an implementation of <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-commons/blob/master/spring-cloud-commons/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/client/discovery/DiscoveryClient.java">Discovery Client</link>
for <link xl:href="https://kubernetes.io">Kubernetes</link>.
This client lets you query Kubernetes endpoints (see <link xl:href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services/">services</link>) by name.
A service is typically exposed by the Kubernetes API server as a collection of endpoints that represent <literal>http</literal> and <literal>https</literal> addresses and that a client can
access from a Spring Boot application running as a pod. This discovery feature is also used by the Spring Cloud Kubernetes Ribbon project
to fetch the list of the endpoints defined for an application to be load balanced.</simpara>
<simpara>This is something that you get for free by adding the following dependency inside your project:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<simpara>To enable loading of the <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal>, add <literal>@EnableDiscoveryClient</literal> to the according configuration or application class, as the following example shows:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@EnableDiscoveryClient
public class Application {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
  }
}</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<simpara>Then you can inject the client in your code simply by autowiring it, as the following example shows:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowired
private DiscoveryClient discoveryClient;</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<simpara>You can choose to enable <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> from all namespaces by setting the following property in <literal>application.properties</literal>:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<screen>spring.cloud.kubernetes.discovery.all-namespaces=true</screen>
</informalexample>
<simpara>If, for any reason, you need to disable the <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal>, you can set the following property in <literal>application.properties</literal>:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<screen>spring.cloud.kubernetes.discovery.enabled=false</screen>
</informalexample>
<simpara>Some Spring Cloud components use the <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> in order to obtain information about the local service instance. For
this to work, you need to align the Kubernetes service name with the <literal>spring.application.name</literal> property.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara><literal>spring.application.name</literal> has no effect as far as the name registered for the application within Kubernetes</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Kubernetes can also watch the Kubernetes service catalog for changes and update the
<literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> implementation accordingly.  In order to enable this functionality you need to add
<literal>@EnableScheduling</literal> on a configuration class in your application.</simpara>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_kubernetes_native_service_discovery">
<title>Kubernetes native service discovery</title>
<simpara>Kubernetes itself is capable of (server side) service discovery (see: <link xl:href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#discovering-services">https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#discovering-services</link>).
Using native kubernetes service discovery ensures compatibility with additional tooling, such as Istio (<link xl:href="https://istio.io">https://istio.io</link>), a service mesh that is capable of load balancing, ribbon, circuit breaker, failover, and much more.</simpara>
<simpara>The caller service then need only refer to names resolvable in a particular Kubernetes cluster. A simple implementation might use a spring <literal>RestTemplate</literal> that refers to a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), such as <literal><link xl:href="https://{service-name}.{namespace}.svc.{cluster}.local:{service-port}">https://{service-name}.{namespace}.svc.{cluster}.local:{service-port}</link></literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Additionally, you can use Hystrix for:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Circuit breaker implementation on the caller side, by annotating the spring boot application class with <literal>@EnableCircuitBreaker</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Fallback functionality, by annotating the respective method with <literal>@HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod=</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_kubernetes_propertysource_implementations">
<title>Kubernetes PropertySource implementations</title>
<simpara>The most common approach to configuring your Spring Boot application is to create an <literal>application.properties</literal> or <literal>applicaiton.yaml</literal> or
an <literal>application-profile.properties</literal> or <literal>application-profile.yaml</literal> file that contains key-value pairs that provide customization values to your
application or Spring Boot starters. You can override these properties by specifying system properties or environment
variables.</simpara>
<section xml:id="configmap-propertysource">
<title>Using a <literal>ConfigMap</literal> <literal>PropertySource</literal></title>
<simpara>Kubernetes provides a resource named <link xl:href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/configmap/"><literal>ConfigMap</literal></link> to externalize the
parameters to pass to your application in the form of key-value pairs or embedded <literal>application.properties</literal> or <literal>application.yaml</literal> files.
The <link xl:href="./spring-cloud-kubernetes-config">Spring Cloud Kubernetes Config</link> project makes Kubernetes <literal>ConfigMap</literal> instances available
during application bootstrapping and triggers hot reloading of beans or Spring context when changes are detected on
observed <literal>ConfigMap</literal> instances.</simpara>
<simpara>The default behavior is to create a <literal>ConfigMapPropertySource</literal> based on a Kubernetes <literal>ConfigMap</literal> that has a <literal>metadata.name</literal> value of either the name of
your Spring application (as defined by its <literal>spring.application.name</literal> property) or a custom name defined within the
<literal>bootstrap.properties</literal> file under the following key: <literal>spring.cloud.kubernetes.config.name</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>However, more advanced configuration is possible where you can use multiple <literal>ConfigMap</literal> instances.
The <literal>spring.cloud.kubernetes.config.sources</literal> list makes this possible.
For example, you could define the following <literal>ConfigMap</literal> instances:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  application:
    name: cloud-k8s-app
  cloud:
    kubernetes:
      config:
        name: default-name
        namespace: default-namespace
        sources:
         # Spring Cloud Kubernetes looks up a ConfigMap named c1 in namespace default-namespace
         - name: c1
         # Spring Cloud Kubernetes looks up a ConfigMap named default-name in whatever namespace n2
         - namespace: n2
         # Spring Cloud Kubernetes looks up a ConfigMap named c3 in namespace n3
         - namespace: n3
           name: c3</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<simpara>In the preceding example, if <literal>spring.cloud.kubernetes.config.namespace</literal> had not been set,
the <literal>ConfigMap</literal> named <literal>c1</literal> would be looked up in the namespace that the application runs.</simpara>
<simpara>Any matching <literal>ConfigMap</literal> that is found is processed as follows:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Apply individual configuration properties.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Apply as <literal>yaml</literal> the content of any property named <literal>application.yaml</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Apply as a properties file the content of any property named <literal>application.properties</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The single exception to the aforementioned flow is when the <literal>ConfigMap</literal> contains a <emphasis role="strong">single</emphasis> key that indicates
the file is a YAML or properties file. In that case, the name of the key does NOT have to be <literal>application.yaml</literal> or
<literal>application.properties</literal> (it can be anything) and the value of the property is treated correctly.
This features facilitates the use case where the <literal>ConfigMap</literal> was created by using something like the following:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<screen>kubectl create configmap game-config --from-file=/path/to/app-config.yaml</screen>
</informalexample>
<simpara>Assume that we have a Spring Boot application named <literal>demo</literal> that uses the following properties to read its thread pool
configuration.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>pool.size.core</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>pool.size.maximum</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>This can be externalized to config map in <literal>yaml</literal> format as follows:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo
data:
  pool.size.core: 1
  pool.size.max: 16</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<simpara>Individual properties work fine for most cases. However, sometimes, embedded <literal>yaml</literal> is more convenient. In this case, we
use a single property named <literal>application.yaml</literal> to embed our <literal>yaml</literal>, as follows:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo
data:
  application.yaml: |-
    pool:
      size:
        core: 1
        max:16</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<simpara>The following example also works:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo
data:
  custom-name.yaml: |-
    pool:
      size:
        core: 1
        max:16</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<simpara>You can also configure Spring Boot applications differently depending on active profiles that are merged together
when the <literal>ConfigMap</literal> is read. You can provide different property values for different profiles by using an
<literal>application.properties</literal> or <literal>application.yaml</literal> property, specifying profile-specific values, each in their own document
(indicated by the <literal>---</literal> sequence), as follows:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo
data:
  application.yml: |-
    greeting:
      message: Say Hello to the World
    farewell:
      message: Say Goodbye
    ---
    spring:
      profiles: development
    greeting:
      message: Say Hello to the Developers
    farewell:
      message: Say Goodbye to the Developers
    ---
    spring:
      profiles: production
    greeting:
      message: Say Hello to the Ops</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<simpara>In the preceding case, the configuration loaded into your Spring Application with the <literal>development</literal> profile is as follows:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">  greeting:
    message: Say Hello to the Developers
  farewell:
    message: Say Goodbye to the Developers</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<simpara>However, if the <literal>production</literal> profile is active, the configuration becomes:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">  greeting:
    message: Say Hello to the Ops
  farewell:
    message: Say Goodbye</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<simpara>If both profiles are active, the property that appears last within the <literal>ConfigMap</literal> overwrites any preceding values.</simpara>
<simpara>Another option is to create a different config map per profile and spring boot will automatically fetch it based
on active profiles</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo
data:
  application.yml: |-
    greeting:
      message: Say Hello to the World
    farewell:
      message: Say Goodbye</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo-development
data:
  application.yml: |-
    spring:
      profiles: development
    greeting:
      message: Say Hello to the Developers
    farewell:
      message: Say Goodbye to the Developers</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo-production
data:
  application.yml: |-
    spring:
      profiles: production
    greeting:
      message: Say Hello to the Ops
    farewell:
      message: Say Goodbye</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<simpara>To tell Spring Boot which <literal>profile</literal> should be enabled at bootstrap, you can pass a system property to the Java
command. To do so, you can launch your Spring Boot application with an environment variable that you can define with the OpenShift
<literal>DeploymentConfig</literal> or Kubernetes <literal>ReplicationConfig</literal> resource file, as follows:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">apiVersion: v1
kind: DeploymentConfig
spec:
  replicas: 1
  ...
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        - name: JAVA_APP_DIR
          value: /deployments
        - name: JAVA_OPTIONS
          value: -Dspring.profiles.active=developer</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<note>
<simpara>You should check the security configuration section. To access config maps from inside a pod you need to have the correct
Kubernetes service accounts, roles and role bindings.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Another option for using <literal>ConfigMap</literal> instances is to mount them into the Pod by running the Spring Cloud Kubernetes application
and having Spring Cloud Kubernetes read them from the file system.
This behavior is controlled by the <literal>spring.cloud.kubernetes.config.paths</literal> property. You can use it in
addition to or instead of the mechanism described earlier.
You can specify multiple (exact) file paths in <literal>spring.cloud.kubernetes.config.paths</literal> by using the <literal>,</literal> delimiter.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>You have to provide the full exact path to each property file, because directories are not being recursively parsed.</simpara>

<title>Secrets PropertySource</title>
<simpara>Kubernetes has the notion of <link xl:href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/">Secrets</link> for storing
sensitive data such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and so on. This project provides integration with <literal>Secrets</literal> to make secrets
accessible by Spring Boot applications. You can explicitly enable or disable This feature by setting the <literal>spring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.enabled</literal> property.</simpara>
<simpara>When enabled, the <literal>SecretsPropertySource</literal> looks up Kubernetes for <literal>Secrets</literal> from the following sources:</simpara>

</orderedlist>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Note:</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>By default, consuming Secrets through the API (points 2 and 3 above) <emphasis role="strong">is not enabled</emphasis> for security reasons. The permission 'list' on secrets allows clients to inspect secrets values in the specified namespace.
Further, we recommend that containers share secrets through mounted volumes.</simpara>
<simpara>If you enable consuming Secrets through the API, we recommend that you limit access to Secrets by using an authorization policy, such as RBAC.
For more information about risks and best practices when consuming Secrets through the API refer to <link xl:href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#best-practices">this doc</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>If the secrets are found, their data is made available to the application.</simpara>
<simpara>Assume that we have a spring boot application named <literal>demo</literal> that uses properties to read its database
configuration. We can create a Kubernetes secret by using the following command:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<screen>oc create secret generic db-secret --from-literal=username=user --from-literal=password=p455w0rd</screen>
</informalexample>
<simpara>The preceding command would create the following secret (which you can see by using <literal>oc get secrets db-secret -o yaml</literal>):</simpara>

<section xml:id="_propertysource_reload">
<title><literal>PropertySource</literal> Reload</title>
<simpara>Some applications may need to detect changes on external property sources and update their internal status to reflect the new configuration.
The reload feature of Spring Cloud Kubernetes is able to trigger an application reload when a related <literal>ConfigMap</literal> or
<literal>Secret</literal> changes.</simpara>
<simpara>By default, this feature is disabled. You can enable it by using the <literal>spring.cloud.kubernetes.reload.enabled=true</literal> configuration property (for example, in the <literal>application.properties</literal> file).</simpara>
<simpara>The following levels of reload are supported (by setting the <literal>spring.cloud.kubernetes.reload.strategy</literal> property):
* <literal>refresh</literal> (default): Only configuration beans annotated with <literal>@ConfigurationProperties</literal> or <literal>@RefreshScope</literal> are reloaded.
This reload level leverages the refresh feature of Spring Cloud Context.
* <literal>restart_context</literal>: the whole Spring <literal>ApplicationContext</literal> is gracefully restarted. Beans are recreated with the new configuration.
* <literal>shutdown</literal>: the Spring <literal>ApplicationContext</literal> is shut down to activate a restart of the container.
 When you use this level, make sure that the lifecycle of all non-daemon threads is bound to the <literal>ApplicationContext</literal>
and that a replication controller or replica set is configured to restart the pod.</simpara>
<simpara>Assuming that the reload feature is enabled with default settings (<literal>refresh</literal> mode), the following bean is refreshed when the config map changes:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<screen>@Configuration
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "bean")
public class MyConfig {

    private String message = "a message that can be changed live";

    // getter and setters

}</screen>
</informalexample>
<simpara>To see that changes effectively happen, you can create another bean that prints the message periodically, as follows</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Component
public class MyBean {

    @Autowired
    private MyConfig config;

    @Scheduled(fixedDelay = 5000)
    public void hello() {
        System.out.println("The message is: " + config.getMessage());
    }
}</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<simpara>You can change the message printed by the application by using a <literal>ConfigMap</literal>, as follows:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: reload-example
data:
  application.properties: |-
    bean.message=Hello World!</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<simpara>Any change to the property named <literal>bean.message</literal> in the <literal>ConfigMap</literal> associated with the pod is reflected in the
output. More generally speaking, changes associated to properties prefixed with the value defined by the <literal>prefix</literal>
field of the <literal>@ConfigurationProperties</literal> annotation are detected and reflected in the application.
<link linkend="configmap-propertysource">Associating a <literal>ConfigMap</literal> with a pod</link> is explained earlier in this chapter.</simpara>
<simpara>The full example is available in <link xl:href="https://github.com/fabric8io/spring-cloud-kubernetes/tree/master/spring-cloud-kubernetes-examples/kubernetes-reload-example"><literal>spring-cloud-kubernetes-reload-example</literal></link>.</simpara>
<simpara>The reload feature supports two operating modes:
* Event (default): Watches for changes in config maps or secrets by using the Kubernetes API (web socket).
Any event produces a re-check on the configuration and, in case of changes, a reload.
The <literal>view</literal> role on the service account is required in order to listen for config map changes. A higher level role (such as <literal>edit</literal>) is required for secrets
(by default, secrets are not monitored).
* Polling: Oeriodically re-creates the configuration from config maps and secrets to see if it has changed.
You can configure the polling period by using the <literal>spring.cloud.kubernetes.reload.period</literal> property and defaults to 15 seconds.
It requires the same role as the monitored property source.
This means, for example, that using polling on file-mounted secret sources does not require particular privileges.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_ribbon_discovery_in_kubernetes">
<title>Ribbon Discovery in Kubernetes</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud client applications that call a microservice should be interested on relying on a client load-balancing
feature in order to automatically discover at which endpoint(s) it can reach a given service. This mechanism has been
implemented within the <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-kubernetes/tree/master/spring-cloud-kubernetes-ribbon">spring-cloud-kubernetes-ribbon</link> project, where a
Kubernetes client populates a <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon">Ribbon</link> <literal>ServerList</literal> that contains information
about such endpoints.</simpara>
<simpara>The implementation is part of the following starter that you can use by adding its dependency to your pom file:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes-ribbon&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;${latest.version}&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<simpara>When the list of the endpoints is populated, the Kubernetes client searches the registered endpoints that live in
the current namespace or project by matching the service name defined in the Ribbon Client annotation, as follows:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RibbonClient(name = "name-service")</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<simpara>You can configure Ribbon&#8217;s behavior by providing properties in your <literal>application.properties</literal> (through your application&#8217;s
dedicated <literal>ConfigMap</literal>) by using the following format: <literal>&lt;name of your service&gt;.ribbon.&lt;Ribbon configuration key&gt;</literal>, where:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>&lt;name of your service&gt;</literal> corresponds to the service name you access over Ribbon, as configured by using the
<literal>@RibbonClient</literal> annotation (such as <literal>name-service</literal> in the preceding example).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>&lt;Ribbon configuration key&gt;</literal> is one of the Ribbon configuration keys defined by
<link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon/blob/master/ribbon-core/src/main/java/com/netflix/client/config/CommonClientConfigKey.java">Ribbon&#8217;s <literal>CommonClientConfigKey</literal> class</link>.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Additionally, the <literal>spring-cloud-kubernetes-ribbon</literal> project defines two additional configuration keys to further
control how Ribbon interacts with Kubernetes. In particular, if an endpoint defines multiple ports, the default
behavior is to use the first one found. To select more specifically which port to use in a multi-port service, you can use
the <literal>PortName</literal> key. If you want to specify in which Kubernetes namespace the target service should be looked up, you can use
the <literal>KubernetesNamespace</literal> key, remembering in both instances to prefix these keys with your service name and
<literal>ribbon</literal> prefix, as specified earlier.</simpara>
<simpara>The following examples use this module for ribbon discovery:</simpara>

<title>Kubernetes Ecosystem Awareness</title>
<simpara>All of the features described earlier in this guide work equally well, regardless of whether your application is running inside
Kubernetes. This is really helpful for development and troubleshooting.
From a development point of view, this lets you start your Spring Boot application and debug one
of the modules that is part of this project. You need not deploy it in Kubernetes,
as the code of the project relies on the
<link xl:href="https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client">Fabric8 Kubernetes Java client</link>, which is a fluent DSL that can
communicate by using <literal>http</literal> protocol to the REST API of the Kubernetes Server.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_kubernetes_profile_autoconfiguration">
<title>Kubernetes Profile Autoconfiguration</title>
<simpara>When the application runs as a pod inside Kubernetes, a Spring profile named <literal>kubernetes</literal> automatically gets activated.
This lets you customize the configuration, to define beans that are applied when the Spring Boot application is deployed
within the Kubernetes platform (for example, different development and production configuration).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_istio_awareness">
<title>Istio Awareness</title>
<simpara>When you include the <literal>spring-cloud-kubernetes-istio</literal> module in the application classpath, a new profile is added to the application,
provided the application is running inside a Kubernetes Cluster with <link xl:href="https://istio.io">Istio</link> installed. You can then use
spring <literal>@Profile("istio")</literal> annotations in your Beans and <literal>@Configuration</literal> classes.</simpara>
<simpara>The Istio awareness module uses  <literal>me.snowdrop:istio-client</literal> to interact with Istio APIs, letting us discover traffic rules, circuit breakers, and so on,
making it easy for our Spring Boot applications to consume this data to dynamically configure themselves according to the environment.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_pod_health_indicator">
<title>Pod Health Indicator</title>

That makes it really useful for exposing health-related information to the user and makes it a good fit for use as <link xl:href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/">readiness probes</link>.</simpara>

<title>Namespace</title>
<simpara>Most of the components provided in this project need to know the namespace. For Kubernetes (1.3+), the namespace is made available to the pod as part of the service account secret and is automatically detected by the client.
For earlier versions, it needs to be specified as an environment variable to the pod. A quick way to do this is as follows:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<screen>      env:
      - name: "KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE"
        valueFrom:
          fieldRef:

</informalexample>
</section>
<section xml:id="_service_account">
<title>Service Account</title>
<simpara>For distributions of Kubernetes that support more fine-grained role-based access within the cluster, you need to make sure a pod that runs with <literal>spring-cloud-kubernetes</literal> has access to the Kubernetes API.
For any service accounts you assign to a deployment or pod, you need to make sure they have the correct roles. For example, you can add <literal>cluster-reader</literal> permissions to your <literal>default</literal> service account, depending on the project you&#8217;re in.</simpara>
</section>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_service_registry_implementation">

<simpara>In Kubernetes service registration is controlled by the platform, the application itself does not control
registration as it may do in other platforms.  For this reason using <literal>spring.cloud.service-registry.auto-registration.enabled</literal>

<title>Examples</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Kubernetes tries to make it transparent for your applications to consume Kubernetes Native Services by

<simpara>In your applications, you need to add the <literal>spring-cloud-kubernetes-discovery</literal> dependency to your classpath and remove any other dependency that contains a <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> implementation (that is, a Eureka discovery client).
The same applies for <literal>PropertySourceLocator</literal>, where you need to add to the classpath the <literal>spring-cloud-kubernetes-config</literal> and remove any other dependency that contains a <literal>PropertySourceLocator</literal> implementation (that is, a configuration server client).</simpara>

<section xml:id="_basic_compile_and_test">
<title>Basic Compile and Test</title>
<simpara>To build the source you will need to install JDK 1.7.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud uses Maven for most build-related activities, and you
should be able to get off the ground quite quickly by cloning the
project you are interested in and typing</simpara>
<screen>$ ./mvnw install</screen>
<note>
<simpara>You can also install Maven (&gt;=3.3.3) yourself and run the <literal>mvn</literal> command
in place of <literal>./mvnw</literal> in the examples below. If you do that you also
might need to add <literal>-P spring</literal> if your local Maven settings do not
contain repository declarations for spring pre-release artifacts.</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>Be aware that you might need to increase the amount of memory
available to Maven by setting a <literal>MAVEN_OPTS</literal> environment variable with
a value like <literal>-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m</literal>. We try to cover this in
the <literal>.mvn</literal> configuration, so if you find you have to do it to make a
build succeed, please raise a ticket to get the settings added to
source control.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>For hints on how to build the project look in <literal>.travis.yml</literal> if there
is one. There should be a "script" and maybe "install" command. Also
look at the "services" section to see if any services need to be
running locally (e.g. mongo or rabbit).  Ignore the git-related bits
that you might find in "before_install" since they&#8217;re related to setting git
credentials and you already have those.</simpara>
<simpara>The projects that require middleware generally include a
<literal>docker-compose.yml</literal>, so consider using
<link xl:href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</link> to run the middeware servers
in Docker containers. See the README in the
<link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/scripts">scripts demo
repository</link> for specific instructions about the common cases of mongo,
rabbit and redis.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>If all else fails, build with the command from <literal>.travis.yml</literal> (usually
<literal>./mvnw install</literal>).</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_documentation">
<title>Documentation</title>
<simpara>The spring-cloud-build module has a "docs" profile, and if you switch
that on it will try to build asciidoc sources from
<literal>src/main/asciidoc</literal>. As part of that process it will look for a
<literal>README.adoc</literal> and process it by loading all the includes, but not
parsing or rendering it, just copying it to <literal>${main.basedir}</literal>
(defaults to <literal>$../../../..</literal>, i.e. the root of the project). If there are
any changes in the README it will then show up after a Maven build as
a modified file in the correct place. Just commit it and push the change.</simpara>

see many different errors related to the POMs in the projects, check
that you have an up to date installation.  If you can&#8217;t upgrade m2e,
add the "spring" profile to your <literal>settings.xml</literal>. Alternatively you can
copy the repository settings from the "spring" profile of the parent
pom into your <literal>settings.xml</literal>.</simpara>

<simpara>If you need to suppress some rules (e.g. line length needs to be longer), then it&#8217;s enough for you to define a file under <literal>${project.root}/src/checkstyle/checkstyle-suppressions.xml</literal> with your suppressions. Example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>projectRoot/src/checkstyle/checkstyle-suppresions.xml</title>
<para>

&lt;!DOCTYPE suppressions PUBLIC

</formalpara>
<simpara>It&#8217;s advisable to copy the <literal>${spring-cloud-build.rootFolder}/.editorconfig</literal> and <literal>${spring-cloud-build.rootFolder}/.springformat</literal> to your project. That way, some default formatting rules will be applied. You can do so by running this script:</simpara>

<title>Dependency Management</title>
<simpara>The Spring Cloud GCP Bill of Materials (BOM) contains the versions of all the dependencies it uses.</simpara>
<simpara>If you’re a Maven user, adding the following to your pom.xml file will allow you to not specify any Spring Cloud GCP dependency versions.
Instead, the version of the BOM you’re using determines the versions of the used dependencies.</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependencyManagement&gt;
    &lt;dependencies&gt;

        &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>In the following sections, it will be assumed you are using the Spring Cloud GCP BOM and the dependency snippets will not contain versions.</simpara>
<simpara>Gradle users can achieve the same kind of BOM experience using Spring&#8217;s <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-gradle-plugins/dependency-management-plugin">dependency-management-plugin</link> Gradle plugin.
For simplicity, the Gradle dependency snippets in the remainder of this document will also omit their versions.</simpara>

<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface CredentialsProvider {

<simpara>The Spring Cloud GCP starter auto-configures a <literal>CredentialsProvider</literal>.
It uses the <literal>spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.location</literal> property to locate the OAuth2 private key of a Google service account.
Keep in mind this property is a Spring Resource, so the credentials file can be obtained from a number of <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/resources.html#resources-implementations">different locations</link> such as the file system, classpath, URL, etc.
The next example specifies the credentials location property in the file system.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.location=file:/usr/local/key.json</screen>
<simpara>Alternatively, you can set the credentials by directly specifying the <literal>spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.encoded-key</literal> property.
The value should be the base64-encoded account private key in JSON format.</simpara>
<simpara>If that credentials aren&#8217;t specified through properties, the starter tries to discover credentials from a <link xl:href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java#authentication">number of places</link>:</simpara>

<simpara>If your app is running on Google App Engine or Google Compute Engine, in most cases, you should omit the <literal>spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.location</literal> property and, instead, let the Spring Cloud GCP Starter get the correct credentials for those environments.

<title>Pub/Sub Operations &amp; Template</title>
<simpara><literal>PubSubOperations</literal> is an abstraction that allows Spring users to use Google Cloud Pub/Sub without depending on any Google Cloud Pub/Sub API semantics.
It provides the common set of operations needed to interact with Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
<literal>PubSubTemplate</literal> is the default implementation of <literal>PubSubOperations</literal> and it uses the <link xl:href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java/tree/master/google-cloud-pubsub">Google Cloud Java Client for Pub/Sub</link> to interact with Google Cloud Pub/Sub.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>PubSubTemplate</literal> depends on a <literal>PublisherFactory</literal> and a <literal>SubscriberFactory</literal>.
The <literal>PublisherFactory</literal> provides a Google Cloud Java Client for Pub/Sub <literal>Publisher</literal>.
The <literal>SubscriberFactory</literal> provides the <literal>Subscriber</literal> for asynchronous message pulling, as well as a <literal>SubscriberStub</literal> for synchronous pulling.
The Spring Boot starter for GCP Pub/Sub auto-configures a <literal>PublisherFactory</literal> and <literal>SubscriberFactory</literal> with default settings and uses the <literal>GcpProjectIdProvider</literal> and <literal>CredentialsProvider</literal> auto-configured by the Spring Boot GCP starter.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>PublisherFactory</literal> implementation provided by Spring Cloud GCP Pub/Sub, <literal>DefaultPublisherFactory</literal>, caches <literal>Publisher</literal> instances by topic name, in order to optimize resource utilization.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>PubSubOperations</literal> interface is actually a combination of <literal>PubSubPublisherOperations</literal> and <literal>PubSubSubscriberOperations</literal> with the corresponding <literal>PubSubPublisherTemplate</literal> and <literal>PubSubSubscriberTemplate</literal> implementations, which can be used individually or via the composite <literal>PubSubTemplate</literal>.
The rest of the documentation refers to <literal>PubSubTemplate</literal>, but the same applies to <literal>PubSubPublisherTemplate</literal> and <literal>PubSubSubscriberTemplate</literal>, depending on whether we&#8217;re talking about publishing or subscribing.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_publishing_to_a_topic">
<title>Publishing to a topic</title>
<simpara><literal>PubSubTemplate</literal> provides asynchronous methods to publish messages to a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic.
The <literal>publish()</literal> method takes in a topic name to post the message to, a payload of a generic type and, optionally, a map with the message headers.</simpara>
<simpara>Here is an example of how to publish a message to a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public void publishMessage() {
    this.pubSubTemplate.publish("topic", "your message payload", ImmutableMap.of("key1", "val1"));
}</programlisting>
<simpara>By default, the <literal>SimplePubSubMessageConverter</literal> is used to convert payloads of type <literal>byte[]</literal>, <literal>ByteString</literal>, <literal>ByteBuffer</literal>, and <literal>String</literal> to Pub/Sub messages.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_json_support">
<title>JSON support</title>
<simpara>For serialization and deserialization of POJOs using Jackson JSON, configure a <literal>JacksonPubSubMessageConverter</literal> bean, and the Spring Boot starter for GCP Pub/Sub will automatically wire it into the <literal>PubSubTemplate</literal>.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// Note: The ObjectMapper is used to convert Java POJOs to and from JSON.
// You will have to configure your own instance if you are unable to depend
// on the ObjectMapper provided by Spring Boot starters.
@Bean
public JacksonPubSubMessageConverter jacksonPubSubMessageConverter(ObjectMapper objectMapper) {
    return new JacksonPubSubMessageConverter(objectMapper);
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Alternatively, you can set it directly by calling the <literal>setMessageConverter()</literal> method on the <literal>PubSubTemplate</literal>.
Other implementations of the <literal>PubSubMessageConverter</literal> can also be configured in the same manner.</simpara>
<simpara>Please refer to our <link xl:href="../spring-cloud-gcp-samples/spring-cloud-gcp-integration-pubsub-json-sample">Pub/Sub JSON Payload Sample App</link> as a reference for using this functionality.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_subscribing_to_a_subscription">
<title>Subscribing to a subscription</title>
<simpara>Google Cloud Pub/Sub allows many subscriptions to be associated to the same topic.
<literal>PubSubTemplate</literal> allows you to listen to subscriptions via the <literal>subscribe()</literal> method.
It relies on a <literal>SubscriberFactory</literal> object, whose only task is to generate Google Cloud Pub/Sub
<literal>Subscriber</literal> objects.
When listening to a subscription, messages will be pulled from Google Cloud Pub/Sub
asynchronously, at a certain interval.</simpara>
<simpara>The Spring Boot starter for Google Cloud Pub/Sub auto-configures a <literal>SubscriberFactory</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>If Pub/Sub message payload conversion is desired, you can use the <literal>subscribeAndConvert()</literal> method, which will use the converter configured in the template.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_pulling_messages_from_a_subscription">
<title>Pulling messages from a subscription</title>
<simpara>Google Cloud Pub/Sub supports synchronous pulling of messages from a subscription.
This is different from subscribing to a subscription, in the sense that subscribing is an asynchronous task which polls the subscription on a set interval.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>pullNext()</literal> method allows for a single message to be pulled and automatically acknowledged from a subscription.
The <literal>pull()</literal> method pulls a number of messages from a subscription, allowing for the retry settings to be configured.
Any messages received by <literal>pull()</literal> are not automatically acknowledged.
Instead, since they are of the kind <literal>AcknowledgeablePubsubMessage</literal>, you can acknowledge them by calling the <literal>ack()</literal> method, or negatively acknowledge them by calling the <literal>nack()</literal> method.
The <literal>pullAndAck()</literal> method does the same as the <literal>pull()</literal> method and, additionally, acknowledges all received messages.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>pullAndConvert()</literal> method does the same as the <literal>pull()</literal> method and, additionally, converts the Pub/Sub binary payload to an object of the desired type, using the converter configured in the template.</simpara>
<simpara>To acknowledge multiple messages received from <literal>pull()</literal> or <literal>pullAndConvert()</literal> at once, you can use the <literal>PubSubTemplate.ack()</literal> method.
You can also use the <literal>PubSubTemplate.nack()</literal> for negatively acknowledging messages.</simpara>
<simpara>Using these methods for acknowledging messages in batches is more efficient than acknowledging messages individually, but they <emphasis role="strong">require</emphasis> the collection of messages to be from the same project.</simpara>
<simpara>All <literal>ack()</literal>, <literal>nack()</literal>, and <literal>modifyAckDeadline()</literal> methods on messages as well as <literal>PubSubSubscriberTemplate</literal> are implemented asynchronously, returning a <literal>ListenableFuture&lt;Void&gt;</literal> to be able to process the asynchronous execution.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>PubSubTemplate</literal> uses a special subscriber generated by its <literal>SubscriberFactory</literal> to synchronously pull messages.</simpara>

Spring Cloud GCP adds a new resource type: a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) object.</simpara>
<simpara>A Spring Boot starter is provided to auto-configure the various Storage components.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_google_cloud_storage">
<title>Google Cloud Storage</title>
<simpara>The Spring Resource Abstraction for Google Cloud Storage allows GCS objects to be accessed by their GCS URL using the <literal>@Value</literal> annotation:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Value("gs://[YOUR_GCS_BUCKET]/[GCS_FILE_NAME]")
private Resource gcsResource;</programlisting>
<simpara>&#8230;&#8203;or the Spring application context</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">SpringApplication.run(...).getResource("gs://[YOUR_GCS_BUCKET]/[GCS_FILE_NAME]");</programlisting>
<simpara>This creates a <literal>Resource</literal> object that can be used to read the object, among <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/resources.html#resources-resource">other possible operations</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>It is also possible to write to a <literal>Resource</literal>, although a <literal>WriteableResource</literal> is required.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Value("gs://[YOUR_GCS_BUCKET]/[GCS_FILE_NAME]")
private Resource gcsResource;
...
try (OutputStream os = ((WritableResource) gcsResource).getOutputStream()) {
  os.write("foo".getBytes());
}</programlisting>
<simpara>To work with the <literal>Resource</literal> as a Google Cloud Storage resource, cast it to <literal>GoogleStorageResource</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>If the resource path refers to an object on Google Cloud Storage (as opposed to a bucket), then the <literal>getBlob</literal> method can be called to obtain a <link xl:href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java/blob/master/google-cloud-storage/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/storage/Blob.java"><literal>Blob</literal></link>.
This type represents a GCS file, which has associated <link xl:href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/addlhelp/WorkingWithObjectMetadata">metadata</link>, such as content-type, that can be set.
The <literal>createSignedUrl</literal> method can also be used to obtain <link xl:href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls">signed URLs</link> for GCS objects.
However, creating signed URLs requires that the resource was created using service account credentials.</simpara>
<simpara>The Spring Boot Starter for Google Cloud Storage auto-configures the <literal>Storage</literal> bean required by the <literal>spring-cloud-gcp-storage</literal> module, based on the <literal>CredentialsProvider</literal> provided by the Spring Boot GCP starter.</simpara>

<title><literal>DataSource</literal> creation flow</title>
<simpara>Based on the previous properties, the Spring Boot starter for Google Cloud SQL creates a <literal>CloudSqlJdbcInfoProvider</literal> object which is used to obtain an instance&#8217;s JDBC URL and driver class name.
If you provide your own <literal>CloudSqlJdbcInfoProvider</literal> bean, it is used instead and the properties related to building the JDBC URL or driver class are ignored.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>DataSourceProperties</literal> object provided by Spring Boot Autoconfigure is mutated in order to use the JDBC URL and driver class names provided by <literal>CloudSqlJdbcInfoProvider</literal>, unless those values were provided in the properties.
It is in the <literal>DataSourceProperties</literal> mutation step that the credentials factory is registered in a system property to be <literal>SqlCredentialFactory</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>DataSource</literal> creation is delegated to
<link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-sql.html">Spring Boot</link>.

<simpara>The channel adapters for Google Cloud Pub/Sub connect your Spring <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/messaging-channels-section.html#channel"><literal>MessageChannels</literal></link> to Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions.
This enables messaging between different processes, applications or micro-services backed up by Google Cloud Pub/Sub.</simpara>
<simpara>The Spring Integration Channel Adapters for Google Cloud Pub/Sub are included in the <literal>spring-cloud-gcp-pubsub</literal> module.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_inbound_channel_adapter">
<title>Inbound channel adapter</title>
<simpara><literal>PubSubInboundChannelAdapter</literal> is the inbound channel adapter for GCP Pub/Sub that listens to a GCP Pub/Sub subscription for new messages.
It converts new messages to an internal Spring <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/messaging-construction-chapter.html#message"><literal>Message</literal></link> and then sends it to the bound output channel.</simpara>
<simpara>Google Pub/Sub treats message payloads as byte arrays.
So, by default, the inbound channel adapter will construct the Spring <literal>Message</literal> with <literal>byte[]</literal> as the payload.
However, you can change the desired payload type by setting the <literal>payloadType</literal> property of the <literal>PubSubInboundChannelAdapter</literal>.
The <literal>PubSubInboundChannelAdapter</literal> delegates the conversion to the desired payload type to the <literal>PubSubMessageConverter</literal> configured in the <literal>PubSubTemplate</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To use the inbound channel adapter, a <literal>PubSubInboundChannelAdapter</literal> must be provided and configured on the user application side.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public MessageChannel pubsubInputChannel() {
    return new PublishSubscribeChannel();
}

@Bean
public PubSubInboundChannelAdapter messageChannelAdapter(
    @Qualifier("pubsubInputChannel") MessageChannel inputChannel,
    SubscriberFactory subscriberFactory) {
    PubSubInboundChannelAdapter adapter =
        new PubSubInboundChannelAdapter(subscriberFactory, "subscriptionName");
    adapter.setOutputChannel(inputChannel);
    adapter.setAckMode(AckMode.MANUAL);

    return adapter;
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In the example, we first specify the <literal>MessageChannel</literal> where the adapter is going to write incoming messages to.
The <literal>MessageChannel</literal> implementation isn&#8217;t important here.
Depending on your use case, you might want to use a <literal>MessageChannel</literal> other than <literal>PublishSubscribeChannel</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Then, we declare a <literal>PubSubInboundChannelAdapter</literal> bean.
It requires the channel we just created and a <literal>SubscriberFactory</literal>, which creates <literal>Subscriber</literal> objects from the Google Cloud Java Client for Pub/Sub.
The Spring Boot starter for GCP Pub/Sub provides a configured <literal>SubscriberFactory</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>PubSubInboundChannelAdapter</literal> supports three acknowledgement modes, with <literal>AckMode.AUTO</literal> being the default value;</simpara>
<simpara>Automatic acking (<literal>AckMode.AUTO</literal>)</simpara>
<simpara>A message is acked with GCP Pub/Sub if the adapter sent it to the channel and no exceptions were thrown.
If a <literal>RuntimeException</literal> is thrown while the message is processed, then the message is nacked.</simpara>
<simpara>Automatic acking OK (<literal>AckMode.AUTO_ACK</literal>)</simpara>
<simpara>A message is acked with GCP Pub/Sub if the adapter sent it to the channel and no exceptions were thrown.
If a <literal>RuntimeException</literal> is thrown while the message is processed, then the message is neither acked / nor nacked.</simpara>
<simpara>This is useful when using the subscription&#8217;s ack deadline timeout as a retry delivery backoff mechanism.</simpara>
<simpara>Manually acking (<literal>AckMode.MANUAL</literal>)</simpara>
<simpara>The adapter attaches a <literal>BasicAcknowledgeablePubsubMessage</literal> object to the <literal>Message</literal> headers.
Users can extract the <literal>BasicAcknowledgeablePubsubMessage</literal> using the <literal>GcpPubSubHeaders.ORIGINAL_MESSAGE</literal> key and use it to (n)ack a message.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "pubsubInputChannel")
public MessageHandler messageReceiver() {
    return message -&gt; {
        LOGGER.info("Message arrived! Payload: " + new String((byte[]) message.getPayload()));
        BasicAcknowledgeablePubsubMessage originalMessage =
              message.getHeaders().get(GcpPubSubHeaders.ORIGINAL_MESSAGE, BasicAcknowledgeablePubsubMessage.class);
        originalMessage.ack();
    };
}</programlisting>

<section xml:id="_outbound_channel_adapter">
<title>Outbound channel adapter</title>
<simpara><literal>PubSubMessageHandler</literal> is the outbound channel adapter for GCP Pub/Sub that listens for new messages on a Spring <literal>MessageChannel</literal>.
It uses <literal>PubSubTemplate</literal> to post them to a GCP Pub/Sub topic.</simpara>
<simpara>To construct a Pub/Sub representation of the message, the outbound channel adapter needs to convert the Spring <literal>Message</literal> payload to a byte array representation expected by Pub/Sub.
It delegates this conversion to the <literal>PubSubTemplate</literal>.
To customize the conversion, you can specify a <literal>PubSubMessageConverter</literal> in the <literal>PubSubTemplate</literal> that should convert the <literal>Object</literal> payload and headers of the Spring <literal>Message</literal> to a <literal>PubsubMessage</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To use the outbound channel adapter, a <literal>PubSubMessageHandler</literal> bean must be provided and configured on the user application side.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "pubsubOutputChannel")
public MessageHandler messageSender(PubSubTemplate pubsubTemplate) {
    return new PubSubMessageHandler(pubsubTemplate, "topicName");
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The provided <literal>PubSubTemplate</literal> contains all the necessary configuration to publish messages to a GCP Pub/Sub topic.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>PubSubMessageHandler</literal> publishes messages asynchronously by default.
A publish timeout can be configured for synchronous publishing.
If none is provided, the adapter waits indefinitely for a response.</simpara>
<simpara>It is possible to set user-defined callbacks for the <literal>publish()</literal> call in <literal>PubSubMessageHandler</literal> through the <literal>setPublishFutureCallback()</literal> method.
These are useful to process the message ID, in case of success, or the error if any was thrown.</simpara>
<simpara>To override the default destination you can use the <literal>GcpPubSubHeaders.DESTINATION</literal> header.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowired
private MessageChannel pubsubOutputChannel;

public void handleMessage(Message&lt;?&gt; msg) throws MessagingException {
    final Message&lt;?&gt; message = MessageBuilder
        .withPayload(msg.getPayload())
        .setHeader(GcpPubSubHeaders.TOPIC, "customTopic").build();
    pubsubOutputChannel.send(message);
}</programlisting>
<simpara>It is also possible to set an SpEL expression for the topic with the <literal>setTopicExpression()</literal> or <literal>setTopicExpressionString()</literal> methods.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_header_mapping">
<title>Header mapping</title>
<simpara>These channel adapters contain header mappers that allow you to map, or filter out, headers from Spring to Google Cloud Pub/Sub messages, and vice-versa.
By default, the inbound channel adapter maps every header on the Google Cloud Pub/Sub messages to the Spring messages produced by the adapter.
The outbound channel adapter maps every header from Spring messages into Google Cloud Pub/Sub ones, except the ones added by Spring, like headers with key <literal>"id"</literal>, <literal>"timestamp"</literal> and <literal>"gcp_pubsub_acknowledgement"</literal>.
In the process, the outbound mapper also converts the value of the headers into string.</simpara>
<simpara>Each adapter declares a <literal>setHeaderMapper()</literal> method to let you further customize which headers you want to map from Spring to Google Cloud Pub/Sub, and vice-versa.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, to filter out headers <literal>"foo"</literal>, <literal>"bar"</literal> and all headers starting with the prefix "prefix_", you can use <literal>setHeaderMapper()</literal> along with the <literal>PubSubHeaderMapper</literal> implementation provided by this module.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">PubSubMessageHandler adapter = ...
...
PubSubHeaderMapper headerMapper = new PubSubHeaderMapper();
headerMapper.setOutboundHeaderPatterns("!foo", "!bar", "!prefix_*", "*");
adapter.setHeaderMapper(headerMapper);</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>The order in which the patterns are declared in <literal>PubSubHeaderMapper.setOutboundHeaderPatterns()</literal> and <literal>PubSubHeaderMapper.setInboundHeaderPatterns()</literal> matters.
The first patterns have precedence over the following ones.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>In the previous example, the <literal>"*"</literal> pattern means every header is mapped.
However, because it comes last in the list, <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/util/PatternMatchUtils.html#smartMatch-java.lang.String-java.lang.String&#8230;&#8203;-">the previous patterns take precedence</link>.</simpara>

</section>
<section xml:id="_configuration_4">
<title>Configuration</title>
<simpara>You can configure the Spring Cloud Stream Binder for Google Cloud Pub/Sub to automatically generate the underlying resources, like the Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions for producers and consumers.
For that, you can use the <literal>spring.cloud.stream.gcp.pubsub.bindings.&lt;channelName&gt;.&lt;consumer|producer&gt;.auto-create-resources</literal> property, which is turned ON by default.</simpara>
<simpara>Starting with version 1.1, these and other binder properties can be configured globally for all the bindings, e.g. <literal>spring.cloud.stream.gcp.pubsub.default.consumer.auto-create-resources</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>If you are using Pub/Sub auto-configuration from the Spring Cloud GCP Pub/Sub Starter, you should refer to the <link linkend="pubsub-configuration">configuration</link> section for other Pub/Sub parameters.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>To use this binder with a <link xl:href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/emulator">running emulator</link>, configure its host and port via <literal>spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.emulator-host</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
<section xml:id="_producer_destination_configuration">
<title>Producer Destination Configuration</title>
<simpara>If automatic resource creation is turned ON and the topic corresponding to the destination name does not exist, it will be created.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, for the following configuration, a topic called <literal>myEvents</literal> would be created.</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.properties</title>

<section xml:id="_consumer_destination_configuration">
<title>Consumer Destination Configuration</title>
<simpara>If automatic resource creation is turned ON and the subscription and/or the topic do not exist for a consumer, a subscription and potentially a topic will be created.
The topic name will be the same as the destination name, and the subscription name will be the destination name followed by the consumer group name.</simpara>
<simpara>Regardless of the <literal>auto-create-resources</literal> setting, if the consumer group is not specified, an anonymous one will be created with the name <literal>anonymous.&lt;destinationName&gt;.&lt;randomUUID&gt;</literal>.
Then when the binder shuts down, all Pub/Sub subscriptions created for anonymous consumer groups will be automatically cleaned up.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, for the following configuration, a topic named <literal>myEvents</literal> and a subscription called <literal>myEvents.counsumerGroup1</literal> would be created.
If the consumer group is not specified, a subscription called <literal>anonymous.myEvents.a6d83782-c5a3-4861-ac38-e6e2af15a7be</literal> would be created and later cleaned up.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_spring_cloud_sleuth_2">
<title>Spring Cloud Sleuth</title>
<simpara><link xl:href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-sleuth/">Spring Cloud Sleuth</link> is an instrumentation framework for Spring Boot applications.
It captures trace information and can forward traces to services like Zipkin for storage and analysis.</simpara>
<simpara>Google Cloud Platform provides its own managed distributed tracing service called <link xl:href="https://cloud.google.com/trace/">Stackdriver Trace</link>.
Instead of running and maintaining your own Zipkin instance and storage, you can use Stackdriver Trace to store traces, view trace details, generate latency distributions graphs, and generate performance regression reports.</simpara>
<simpara>This Spring Cloud GCP starter can forward Spring Cloud Sleuth traces to Stackdriver Trace without an intermediary Zipkin server.</simpara>
<simpara>Maven coordinates, using Spring Cloud GCP BOM:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;

&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Gradle coordinates:</simpara>
<screen>dependencies {
    compile group: 'org.springframework.cloud', name: 'spring-cloud-gcp-starter-trace'
}</screen>
<simpara>You must enable Stackdriver Trace API from the Google Cloud Console in order to capture traces.
Navigate to the <link xl:href="https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/cloudtrace.googleapis.com/overview">Stackdriver Trace API</link> for your project and make sure it’s enabled.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>If you are already using a Zipkin server capturing trace information from multiple platform/frameworks, you can also use a <link xl:href="https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/zipkin">Stackdriver Zipkin proxy</link> to forward those traces to Stackdriver Trace without modifying existing applications.</simpara>
</note>
<section xml:id="_tracing_2">
<title>Tracing</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Sleuth uses the <link xl:href="https://github.com/openzipkin/brave">Brave tracer</link> to generate traces.
This integration enables Brave to use the <link xl:href="https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-gcp/tree/master/propagation-stackdriver"><literal>StackdriverTracePropagation</literal></link> propagation.</simpara>
<simpara>A propagation is responsible for extracting trace context from an entity (e.g., an HTTP servlet request) and injecting trace context into an entity.
A canonical example of the propagation usage is a web server that receives an HTTP request, which triggers other HTTP requests from the server before returning an HTTP response to the original caller.
In the case of <literal>StackdriverTracePropagation</literal>, first it looks for trace context in the <literal>x-cloud-trace-context</literal> key (e.g., an HTTP request header).
The value of the <literal>x-cloud-trace-context</literal> key can be formatted in three different ways:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>x-cloud-trace-context: TRACE_ID</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>x-cloud-trace-context: TRACE_ID/SPAN_ID</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>x-cloud-trace-context: TRACE_ID/SPAN_ID;o=TRACE_TRUE</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara><literal>TRACE_ID</literal> is a 32-character hexadecimal value that encodes a 128-bit number.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>SPAN_ID</literal> is an unsigned long.
Since Stackdriver Trace doesn&#8217;t support span joins, a new span ID is always generated, regardless of the one specified in <literal>x-cloud-trace-context</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>TRACE_TRUE</literal> can either be <literal>0</literal> if the entity should be untraced, or <literal>1</literal> if it should be traced.
This field forces the decision of whether or not to trace the request; if omitted then the decision is deferred to the sampler.</simpara>
<simpara>If a <literal>x-cloud-trace-context</literal> key isn&#8217;t found, <literal>StackdriverTracePropagation</literal> falls back to tracing with the <link xl:href="https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation">X-B3 headers</link>.</simpara>

<simpara>You can use core Spring Cloud Sleuth properties to control Sleuth’s sampling rate, etc.
Read <link xl:href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-sleuth/">Sleuth documentation</link> for more information on Sleuth configurations.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, when you are testing to see the traces are going through, you can set the sampling rate to 100%.</simpara>
<screen>spring.sleuth.sampler.probability=1                     # Send 100% of the request traces to Stackdriver.

<simpara>Spring Cloud GCP Trace does override some Sleuth configurations:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Always uses 128-bit Trace IDs.
This is required by Stackdriver Trace.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Does not use Span joins.
Span joins will share the span ID between the client and server Spans.
Stackdriver requires that every Span ID within a Trace to be unique, so Span joins are not supported.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Uses <literal>StackdriverHttpClientParser</literal> and <literal>StackdriverHttpServerParser</literal> by default to populate Stackdriver related fields.</simpara>

<title>Overriding the auto-configuration</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Sleuth supports sending traces to multiple tracing systems as of version 2.1.0.
In order to get this to work, every tracing system needs to have a <literal>Reporter&lt;Span&gt;</literal> and <literal>Sender</literal>.
If you want to override the provided beans you need to give them a specific name.
To do this you can use respectively <literal>StackdriverTraceAutoConfiguration.REPORTER_BEAN_NAME</literal> and <literal>StackdriverTraceAutoConfiguration.SENDER_BEAN_NAME</literal>.</simpara>

<simpara>Integration with Stackdriver Logging is available through the <link xl:href="logging.adoc">Stackdriver Logging Support</link>.
If the Trace integration is used together with the Logging one, the request logs will be associated to the corresponding traces.
The trace logs can be viewed by going to the <link xl:href="https://console.cloud.google.com/traces/traces">Google Cloud Console Trace List</link>, selecting a trace and pressing the <literal>Logs &#8594; View</literal> link in the <literal>Details</literal> section.</simpara>

<simpara><link xl:href="https://cloud.google.com/logging/">Stackdriver Logging</link> is the managed logging service provided by Google Cloud Platform.</simpara>
<simpara>This module provides support for associating a web request trace ID with the corresponding log entries.
It does so by retrieving the <literal>X-B3-TraceId</literal> value from the <link xl:href="https://logback.qos.ch/manual/mdc.html">Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC)</link>, which is set by Spring Cloud Sleuth.
If Spring Cloud Sleuth isn&#8217;t used, the configured <literal>TraceIdExtractor</literal> extracts the desired header value and sets it as the log entry&#8217;s trace ID.
This allows grouping of log messages by request, for example, in the <link xl:href="https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/viewer">Google Cloud Console Logs viewer</link>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Due to the way logging is set up, the GCP project ID and credentials defined in <literal>application.properties</literal> are ignored.
Instead, you should set the <literal>GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT</literal> and <literal>GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS</literal> environment variables to the project ID and credentials private key location, respectively.
You can do this easily if you&#8217;re using the <link xl:href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk">Google Cloud SDK</link>, using the <literal>gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]</literal> and <literal>gcloud auth application-default login</literal> commands, respectively.</simpara>
</note>
<section xml:id="_web_mvc_interceptor">
<title>Web MVC Interceptor</title>
<simpara>For use in Web MVC-based applications, <literal>TraceIdLoggingWebMvcInterceptor</literal> is provided that extracts the request trace ID from an HTTP request using a <literal>TraceIdExtractor</literal> and stores it in a thread-local, which can then be used in a logging appender to add the trace ID metadata to log messages.</simpara>
<warning>
<simpara>If Spring Cloud GCP Trace is enabled, the logging module disables itself and delegates log correlation to Spring Cloud Sleuth.</simpara>
</warning>
<simpara><literal>LoggingWebMvcConfigurer</literal> configuration class is also provided to help register the <literal>TraceIdLoggingWebMvcInterceptor</literal> in Spring MVC applications.</simpara>
<simpara>Applications hosted on the Google Cloud Platform include trace IDs under the <literal>x-cloud-trace-context</literal> header, which will be included in log entries.
However, if Sleuth is used the trace ID will be picked up from the MDC.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_logback_support">
<title>Logback Support</title>
<simpara>Currently, only Logback is supported and there are 2 possibilities to log to Stackdriver via this library with Logback: via direct API calls and through JSON-formatted console logs.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_log_via_api">
<title>Log via API</title>
<simpara>A Stackdriver appender is available using <literal>org/springframework/cloud/gcp/autoconfigure/logging/logback-appender.xml</literal>.
This appender builds a Stackdriver Logging log entry from a JUL or Logback log entry, adds a trace ID to it and sends it to Stackdriver Logging.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>STACKDRIVER_LOG_NAME</literal> and <literal>STACKDRIVER_LOG_FLUSH_LEVEL</literal> environment variables can be used to customize the <literal>STACKDRIVER</literal> appender.</simpara>
<simpara>Your configuration may then look like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;include resource="org/springframework/cloud/gcp/autoconfigure/logging/logback-appender.xml" /&gt;

  &lt;root level="INFO"&gt;
    &lt;appender-ref ref="STACKDRIVER" /&gt;

<simpara>If you want to have more control over the log output, you can further configure the appender.

<simpara>For Logback, a <literal>org/springframework/cloud/gcp/autoconfigure/logging/logback-json-appender.xml</literal> file is made available for import to make it easier to configure the JSON Logback appender.</simpara>
<simpara>Your configuration may then look something like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;configuration&gt;

&lt;/configuration&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>If your application is running on Google Kubernetes Engine, Google Compute Engine or Google App Engine Flexible, your console logging is automatically saved to Google Stackdriver Logging.
Therefore, you can just include <literal>org/springframework/cloud/gcp/autoconfigure/logging/logback-json-appender.xml</literal> in your logging configuration, which logs JSON entries to the console.
The trace id will be set correctly.</simpara>

<title>Object Mapping</title>
<simpara>Spring Data Cloud Spanner allows you to map domain POJOs to Cloud Spanner tables via annotations:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Table(name = "traders")
public class Trader {

	@PrimaryKey
	@Column(name = "trader_id")
	String traderId;

	String firstName;

	String lastName;

	@NotMapped
	Double temporaryNumber;
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Spring Data Cloud Spanner will ignore any property annotated with <literal>@NotMapped</literal>.
These properties will not be written to or read from Spanner.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_constructors">
<title>Constructors</title>
<simpara>Simple constructors are supported on POJOs.
The constructor arguments can be a subset of the persistent properties.
Every constructor argument needs to have the same name and type as a persistent property on the entity and the constructor should set the property from the given argument.
Arguments that are not directly set to properties are not supported.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Table(name = "traders")
public class Trader {
	@PrimaryKey
	@Column(name = "trader_id")
	String traderId;

	String firstName;

	String lastName;

	@NotMapped
	Double temporaryNumber;

	public Trader(String traderId, String firstName) {
	    this.traderId = traderId;
	    this.firstName = firstName;
	}
}</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_table">
<title>Table</title>
<simpara>The <literal>@Table</literal> annotation can provide the name of the Cloud Spanner table that stores instances of the annotated class, one per row.
This annotation is optional, and if not given, the name of the table is inferred from the class name with the first character uncapitalized.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_spel_expressions_for_table_names">
<title>SpEL expressions for table names</title>
<simpara>In some cases, you might want the <literal>@Table</literal> table name to be determined dynamically.
To do that, you can use <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#expressions">Spring Expression Language</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>For example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Table(name = "trades_#{tableNameSuffix}")
public class Trade {
	// ...
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The table name will be resolved only if the <literal>tableNameSuffix</literal> value/bean in the Spring application context is defined.
For example, if <literal>tableNameSuffix</literal> has the value "123", the table name will resolve to <literal>trades_123</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="_primary_keys">
<title>Primary Keys</title>
<simpara>For a simple table, you may only have a primary key consisting of a single column.
Even in that case, the <literal>@PrimaryKey</literal> annotation is required.
<literal>@PrimaryKey</literal> identifies the one or more ID properties corresponding to the primary key.</simpara>
<simpara>Spanner has first class support for composite primary keys of multiple columns.
You have to annotate all of your POJO&#8217;s fields that the primary key consists of with <literal>@PrimaryKey</literal> as below:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Table(name = "trades")
public class Trade {
	@PrimaryKey(keyOrder = 2)
	@Column(name = "trade_id")
	private String tradeId;

	@PrimaryKey(keyOrder = 1)
	@Column(name = "trader_id")
	private String traderId;

	private String action;

	private Double price;

	private Double shares;

	private String symbol;
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>keyOrder</literal> parameter of <literal>@PrimaryKey</literal> identifies the properties corresponding to the primary key columns in order, starting with 1 and increasing consecutively.
Order is important and must reflect the order defined in the Cloud Spanner schema.
In our example the DDL to create the table and its primary key is as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="sql" linenumbering="unnumbered">CREATE TABLE trades (
    trader_id STRING(MAX),
    trade_id STRING(MAX),
    action STRING(15),
    symbol STRING(10),
    price FLOAT64,
    shares FLOAT64
) PRIMARY KEY (trader_id, trade_id)</programlisting>
<simpara>Spanner does not have automatic ID generation.
For most use-cases, sequential IDs should be used with caution to avoid creating data hotspots in the system.
Read <link xl:href="https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/schema-and-data-model#primary_keys">Spanner Primary Keys documentation</link> for a better understanding of primary keys and recommended practices.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_columns">
<title>Columns</title>
<simpara>All accessible properties on POJOs are automatically recognized as a Cloud Spanner column.
Column naming is generated by the <literal>PropertyNameFieldNamingStrategy</literal> by default defined on the <literal>SpannerMappingContext</literal> bean.
The <literal>@Column</literal> annotation optionally provides a different column name than that of the property and some other settings:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>name</literal> is the optional name of the column</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>spannerTypeMaxLength</literal> specifies for <literal>STRING</literal> and <literal>BYTES</literal> columns the maximum length.
This setting is only used when generating DDL schema statements based on domain types.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>nullable</literal> specifies if the column is created as <literal>NOT NULL</literal>.
This setting is only used when generating DDL schema statements based on domain types.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>spannerType</literal> is the Cloud Spanner column type you can optionally specify.
If this is not specified then a compatible column type is inferred from the Java property type.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>spannerCommitTimestamp</literal> is a boolean specifying if this property corresponds to an auto-populated commit timestamp column.
Any value set in this property will be ignored when writing to Cloud Spanner.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>
<section xml:id="_embedded_objects">
<title>Embedded Objects</title>
<simpara>If an object of type <literal>B</literal> is embedded as a property of <literal>A</literal>, then the columns of <literal>B</literal> will be saved in the same Cloud Spanner table as those of <literal>A</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>If <literal>B</literal> has primary key columns, those columns will be included in the primary key of <literal>A</literal>. <literal>B</literal> can also have embedded properties.
Embedding allows reuse of columns between multiple entities, and can be useful for implementing parent-child situations, because Cloud Spanner requires child tables to include the key columns of their parents.</simpara>
<simpara>For example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">class X {
  @PrimaryKey
  String grandParentId;

  long age;
}

class A {
  @PrimaryKey
  @Embedded
  X grandParent;

  @PrimaryKey(keyOrder = 2)
  String parentId;

  String value;
}

@Table(name = "items")
class B {
  @PrimaryKey
  @Embedded
  A parent;

  @PrimaryKey(keyOrder = 2)
  String id;

  @Column(name = "child_value")
  String value;
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Entities of <literal>B</literal> can be stored in a table defined as:</simpara>
<programlisting language="sql" linenumbering="unnumbered">CREATE TABLE items (
    grandParentId STRING(MAX),
    parentId STRING(MAX),
    id STRING(MAX),
    value STRING(MAX),
    child_value STRING(MAX),
    age INT64
) PRIMARY KEY (grandParentId, parentId, id)</programlisting>
<simpara>Note that embedded properties' column names must all be unique.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_relationships">
<title>Relationships</title>
<simpara>Spring Data Cloud Spanner supports parent-child relationships using the Cloud Spanner <link xl:href="https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/schema-and-data-model#creating-interleaved-tables">parent-child interleaved table mechanism</link>.
Cloud Spanner interleaved tables enforce the one-to-many relationship and provide efficient queries and operations on entities of a single domain parent entity.
These relationships can be up to 7 levels deep.
Cloud Spanner also provides automatic cascading delete or enforces the deletion of child entities before parents.</simpara>
<simpara>While one-to-one and many-to-many relationships can be implemented in Cloud Spanner and Spring Data Cloud Spanner using constructs of interleaved parent-child tables, only the parent-child relationship is natively supported.
Cloud Spanner does not support the foreign key constraint, though the parent-child key constraint enforces a similar requirement when used with interleaved tables.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, the following Java entities:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Table(name = "Singers")
class Singer {
  @PrimaryKey
  long SingerId;

  String FirstName;

  String LastName;

  byte[] SingerInfo;

  @Interleaved
  List&lt;Album&gt; albums;
}

@Table(name = "Albums")
class Album {
  @PrimaryKey
  long SingerId;

  @PrimaryKey(keyOrder = 2)
  long AlbumId;

  String AlbumTitle;
}</programlisting>
<simpara>These classes can correspond to an existing pair of interleaved tables.
The <literal>@Interleaved</literal> annotation may be applied to <literal>Collection</literal> properties and the inner type is resolved as the child entity type.
The schema needed to create them can also be generated using the <literal>SpannerSchemaUtils</literal> and executed using the <literal>SpannerDatabaseAdminTemplate</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowired
SpannerSchemaUtils schemaUtils;

@Autowired
SpannerDatabaseAdminTemplate databaseAdmin;
...

// Get the create statmenets for all tables in the table structure rooted at Singer
List&lt;String&gt; createStrings = this.schemaUtils.getCreateTableDdlStringsForInterleavedHierarchy(Singer.class);

// Create the tables and also create the database if necessary
this.databaseAdmin.executeDdlStrings(createStrings, true);</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>createStrings</literal> list contains table schema statements using column names and types compatible with the provided Java type and any resolved child relationship types contained within based on the configured custom converters.</simpara>
<programlisting language="sql" linenumbering="unnumbered">CREATE TABLE Singers (
  SingerId   INT64 NOT NULL,
  FirstName  STRING(1024),
  LastName   STRING(1024),
  SingerInfo BYTES(MAX),
) PRIMARY KEY (SingerId);

CREATE TABLE Albums (
  SingerId     INT64 NOT NULL,
  AlbumId      INT64 NOT NULL,
  AlbumTitle   STRING(MAX),
) PRIMARY KEY (SingerId, AlbumId),
  INTERLEAVE IN PARENT Singers ON DELETE CASCADE;</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>ON DELETE CASCADE</literal> clause indicates that Cloud Spanner will delete all Albums of a singer if the Singer is deleted.
The alternative is <literal>ON DELETE NO ACTION</literal>, where a Singer cannot be deleted until all of its Albums have already been deleted.
When using <literal>SpannerSchemaUtils</literal> to generate the schema strings, the <literal>spring.cloud.gcp.spanner.createInterleavedTableDdlOnDeleteCascade</literal> boolean setting determines if these schema are generated as <literal>ON DELETE CASCADE</literal> for <literal>true</literal> and <literal>ON DELETE NO ACTION</literal> for <literal>false</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Cloud Spanner restricts these relationships to 7 child layers.
A table may have multiple child tables.</simpara>
<simpara>On updating or inserting an object to Cloud Spanner, all of its referenced children objects are also updated or inserted in the same request, respectively.
On read, all of the interleaved child rows are also all read.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_supported_types">
<title>Supported Types</title>
<simpara>Spring Data Cloud Spanner natively supports the following types for regular fields but also utilizes custom converters (detailed in following sections) and dozens of pre-defined Spring Data custom converters to handle other common Java types.</simpara>

<simpara>Cloud Spanner queries can <link xl:href="https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/query-syntax#using-structs-with-select">construct STRUCT values</link> that appear as columns in the result.
Cloud Spanner requires STRUCT values appear in ARRAYs at the root level: <literal>SELECT ARRAY(SELECT STRUCT(1 as val1, 2 as val2)) as pair FROM Users</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Data Cloud Spanner will attempt to read the column STRUCT values into a property that is an <literal>Iterable</literal> of an entity type compatible with the schema of the column STRUCT value.</simpara>
<simpara>For the previous array-select example, the following property can be mapped with the constructed <literal>ARRAY&lt;STRUCT&gt;</literal> column: <literal>List&lt;TwoInts&gt; pair;</literal> where the <literal>TwoInts</literal> type is defined:</simpara>

<title>SQL Query</title>
<simpara>Cloud Spanner has SQL support for running read-only queries.
All the query related methods start with <literal>query</literal> on <literal>SpannerTemplate</literal>.
Using <literal>SpannerTemplate</literal> you can execute SQL queries that map to POJOs:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">List&lt;Trade&gt; trades = this.spannerTemplate.query(Trade.class, Statement.of("SELECT * FROM trades"));</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_read">
<title>Read</title>
<simpara>Spanner exposes a <link xl:href="https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/reads">Read API</link> for reading single row or multiple rows in a table or in a secondary index.</simpara>
<simpara>Using <literal>SpannerTemplate</literal> you can execute reads, for example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">List&lt;Trade&gt; trades = this.spannerTemplate.readAll(Trade.class);</programlisting>
<simpara>Main benefit of reads over queries is reading multiple rows of a certain pattern of keys is much easier using the features of the <link xl:href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java/blob/master/google-cloud-spanner/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/spanner/KeySet.java"><literal>KeySet</literal></link> class.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_advanced_reads">
<title>Advanced reads</title>
<section xml:id="_stale_read">
<title>Stale read</title>
<simpara>All reads and queries are <emphasis role="strong">strong reads</emphasis> by default.
A <emphasis role="strong">strong read</emphasis> is a read at a current timestamp and is guaranteed to see all data that has been committed up until the start of this read.
A <emphasis role="strong">stale read</emphasis> on the other hand is read at a timestamp in the past.
Cloud Spanner allows you to determine how current the data should be when you read data.
With <literal>SpannerTemplate</literal> you can specify the <literal>Timestamp</literal> by setting it on <literal>SpannerQueryOptions</literal> or <literal>SpannerReadOptions</literal> to the appropriate read or query methods:</simpara>
<simpara>Reads:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// a read with options:
SpannerReadOptions spannerReadOptions = new SpannerReadOptions().setTimestamp(Timestamp.now());
List&lt;Trade&gt; trades = this.spannerTemplate.readAll(Trade.class, spannerReadOptions);</programlisting>
<simpara>Queries:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// a query with options:
SpannerQueryOptions spannerQueryOptions = new SpannerQueryOptions().setTimestamp(Timestamp.now());
List&lt;Trade&gt; trades = this.spannerTemplate.query(Trade.class, Statement.of("SELECT * FROM trades"), spannerQueryOptions);</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_read_from_a_secondary_index">
<title>Read from a secondary index</title>
<simpara>Using a <link xl:href="https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/secondary-indexes">secondary index</link> is available for Reads via the Template API and it is also implicitly available via SQL for Queries.</simpara>
<simpara>The following shows how to read rows from a table using a <link xl:href="https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/secondary-indexes">secondary index</link> simply by setting <literal>index</literal> on <literal>SpannerReadOptions</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">SpannerReadOptions spannerReadOptions = new SpannerReadOptions().setIndex("TradesByTrader");
List&lt;Trade&gt; trades = this.spannerTemplate.readAll(Trade.class, spannerReadOptions);</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_read_with_offsets_and_limits">
<title>Read with offsets and limits</title>
<simpara>Limits and offsets are only supported by Queries.
The following will get only the first two rows of the query:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">SpannerQueryOptions spannerQueryOptions = new SpannerQueryOptions().setLimit(2).setOffset(3);
List&lt;Trade&gt; trades = this.spannerTemplate.query(Trade.class, Statement.of("SELECT * FROM trades"), spannerQueryOptions);</programlisting>
<simpara>Note that the above is equivalent of executing <literal>SELECT * FROM trades LIMIT 2 OFFSET 3</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_sorting">
<title>Sorting</title>
<simpara>Reads by keys do not support sorting.
However, queries on the Template API support sorting through standard SQL and also via Spring Data Sort API:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">List&lt;Trade&gt; trades = this.spannerTemplate.queryAll(Trade.class, Sort.by("action"));</programlisting>
<simpara>If the provided sorted field name is that of a property of the domain type, then the column name corresponding to that property will be used in the query.
Otherwise, the given field name is assumed to be the name of the column in the Cloud Spanner table.
Sorting on columns of Cloud Spanner types STRING and BYTES can be done while ignoring case:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">Sort.by(Order.desc("action").ignoreCase())</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_partial_read">
<title>Partial read</title>
<simpara>Partial read is only possible when using Queries.
In case the rows returned by the query have fewer columns than the entity that it will be mapped to, Spring Data will map the returned columns only.
This setting also applies to nested structs and their corresponding nested POJO properties.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">List&lt;Trade&gt; trades = this.spannerTemplate.query(Trade.class, Statement.of("SELECT action, symbol FROM trades"),
    new SpannerQueryOptions().setAllowMissingResultSetColumns(true));</programlisting>
<simpara>If the setting is set to <literal>false</literal>, then an exception will be thrown if there are missing columns in the query result.</simpara>

<title>Repositories</title>
<simpara><link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-commons/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories">Spring Data Repositories</link> are a powerful abstraction that can save you a lot of boilerplate code.</simpara>
<simpara>For example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface TraderRepository extends SpannerRepository&lt;Trader, String&gt; {
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Spring Data generates a working implementation of the specified interface, which can be conveniently autowired into an application.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>Trader</literal> type parameter to <literal>SpannerRepository</literal> refers to the underlying domain type.
The second type parameter, <literal>String</literal> in this case, refers to the type of the key of the domain type.</simpara>
<simpara>For POJOs with a composite primary key, this ID type parameter can be any descendant of <literal>Object[]</literal> compatible with all primary key properties, any descendant of <literal>Iterable</literal>, or <literal>com.google.cloud.spanner.Key</literal>.
If the domain POJO type only has a single primary key column, then the primary key property type can be used or the <literal>Key</literal> type.</simpara>
<simpara>For example in case of Trades, that belong to a Trader, <literal>TradeRepository</literal> would look like this:</simpara>

<title>Paging and Sorting Repository</title>
<simpara>You can also use <literal>PagingAndSortingRepository</literal> with Spanner Spring Data.

</section>
<section xml:id="_spanner_repository">
<title>Spanner Repository</title>
<simpara>The <literal>SpannerRepository</literal> extends the <literal>PagingAndSortingRepository</literal>, but adds the read-only and the read-write transaction functionality provided by Spanner.
These transactions work very similarly to those of <literal>SpannerOperations</literal>, but is specific to the repository&#8217;s domain type and provides repository functions instead of template functions.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, this is a read-write transaction:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowired
SpannerRepository myRepo;

public String doWorkInsideTransaction() {
  return myRepo.performReadOnlyTransaction(
    transactionSpannerRepo -&gt; {
      // Work with the single-transaction transactionSpannerRepo here.
      // This is a SpannerRepository object.

      return "transaction completed";
    }
  );
}</programlisting>
<simpara>When creating custom repositories for your own domain types and query methods, you can extend <literal>SpannerRepository</literal> to access Cloud Spanner-specific features as well as all features from <literal>PagingAndSortingRepository</literal> and <literal>CrudRepository</literal>.</simpara>

<title>Query Methods</title>
<simpara><literal>SpannerRepository</literal> supports Query Methods.
Described in the following sections, these are methods residing in your custom repository interfaces of which implementations are generated based on their names and annotations.
Query Methods can read, write, and delete entities in Cloud Spanner.
Parameters to these methods can be any Cloud Spanner data type supported directly or via custom configured converters.
Parameters can also be of type <literal>Struct</literal> or POJOs.
If a POJO is given as a parameter, it will be converted to a <literal>Struct</literal> with the same type-conversion logic as used to create write mutations.
Comparisons using Struct parameters are limited to <link xl:href="https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/data-types#limited-comparisons-for-struct">what is available with Cloud Spanner</link>.</simpara>

<simpara>The example above for <literal>List&lt;Trade&gt; fetchByActionNamedQuery(String action)</literal> does not match the <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-commons/docs/current/reference/html#repositories.query-methods.query-creation">Spring Data Query creation naming convention</link>, so we have to map a parametrized Spanner SQL query to it.</simpara>
<simpara>The SQL query for the method can be mapped to repository methods in one of two ways:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>namedQueries</literal> properties file</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>using the <literal>@Query</literal> annotation</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The names of the tags of the SQL correspond to the <literal>@Param</literal> annotated names of the method parameters.</simpara>
<simpara>Custom SQL query methods can accept a single <literal>Sort</literal> or <literal>Pageable</literal> parameter that is applied on top of any sorting or paging in the SQL:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">	@Query("SELECT * FROM trades ORDER BY action DESC")
	List&lt;Trade&gt; sortedTrades(Pageable pageable);

	@Query("SELECT * FROM trades ORDER BY action DESC LIMIT 1")
 	Trade sortedTopTrade(Pageable pageable);</programlisting>
<simpara>This can be used:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">	List&lt;Trade&gt; customSortedTrades = tradeRepository.sortedTrades(PageRequest
  				.of(2, 2, org.springframework.data.domain.Sort.by(Order.asc("id"))));</programlisting>
<simpara>The results would be sorted by "id" in ascending order.</simpara>
<simpara>Your query method can also return non-entity types:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">  	@Query("SELECT COUNT(1) FROM trades WHERE action = @action")
  	int countByActionQuery(String action);

  	@Query("SELECT EXISTS(SELECT COUNT(1) FROM trades WHERE action = @action)")

  	@Query("SELECT action FROM trades WHERE action = @action LIMIT 1")
  	String getFirstString(@Param("action") String action);

  	@Query("SELECT action FROM trades WHERE action = @action")
  	List&lt;String&gt; getFirstStringList(@Param("action") String action);</programlisting>
<simpara>DML statements can also be executed by query methods, but the only possible return value is a <literal>long</literal> representing the number of affected rows.
The <literal>dmlStatement</literal> boolean setting must be set on <literal>@Query</literal> to indicate that the query method is executed as a DML statement.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">  	@Query(value = "DELETE FROM trades WHERE action = @action", dmlStatement = true)
  	long deleteByActionQuery(String action);</programlisting>
<section xml:id="_query_methods_with_named_queries_properties">

<simpara>By default, the <literal>namedQueriesLocation</literal> attribute on <literal>@EnableSpannerRepositories</literal> points to the <literal>META-INF/spanner-named-queries.properties</literal> file.
You can specify the query for a method in the properties file by providing the SQL as the value for the "interface.method" property:</simpara>
<programlisting language="properties" linenumbering="unnumbered">Trade.fetchByActionNamedQuery=SELECT * FROM trades WHERE trades.action = @tag0</programlisting>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface TradeRepository extends SpannerRepository&lt;Trade, String[]&gt; {
	// This method uses the query from the properties file instead of one generated based on name.

    @Query("SELECT * FROM trades WHERE trades.action = @tag0")
    List&lt;Trade&gt; fetchByActionNamedQuery(@Param("tag0") String action);
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Table names can be used directly.
For example, "trades" in the above example.
Alternatively, table names can be resolved from the <literal>@Table</literal> annotation on domain classes as well.
In this case, the query should refer to table names with fully qualified class names between <literal>:</literal>
characters: <literal>:fully.qualified.ClassName:</literal>.
A full example would look like:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Query("SELECT * FROM :com.example.Trade: WHERE trades.action = @tag0")
List&lt;Trade&gt; fetchByActionNamedQuery(String action);</programlisting>
<simpara>This allows table names evaluated with SpEL to be used in custom queries.</simpara>
<simpara>SpEL can also be used to provide SQL parameters:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Query("SELECT * FROM :com.example.Trade: WHERE trades.action = @tag0
  AND price &gt; #{#priceRadius * -1} AND price &lt; #{#priceRadius * 2}")
List&lt;Trade&gt; fetchByActionNamedQuery(String action, Double priceRadius);</programlisting>

<section xml:id="_projections">
<title>Projections</title>
<simpara>Spring Data Spanner supports <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-commons/docs/current/reference/html/#projections">projections</link>.
You can define projection interfaces based on domain types and add query methods that return them in your repository:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface TradeProjection {

	String getAction();

	@Value("#{target.symbol + ' ' + target.action}")

	List&lt;TradeProjection&gt; findByAction(String action);

	@Query("SELECT action, symbol FROM trades WHERE action = @action")
	List&lt;TradeProjection&gt; findByQuery(String action);
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Projections can be provided by name-convention-based query methods as well as by custom SQL queries.
If using custom SQL queries, you can further restrict the columns retrieved from Spanner to just those required by the projection to improve performance.</simpara>
<simpara>Properties of projection types defined using SpEL use the fixed name <literal>target</literal> for the underlying domain object.
As a result accessing underlying properties take the form <literal>target.&lt;property-name&gt;</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_rest_repositories">
<title>REST Repositories</title>
<simpara>When running with Spring Boot, repositories can be exposed as REST services by simply adding this dependency to your pom file:</simpara>

<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RepositoryRestResource(collectionResourceRel = "trades", path = "trades")
public interface TradeRepository extends SpannerRepository&lt;Trade, String[]&gt; {
}</programlisting>
<simpara>For example, you can retrieve all <literal>Trade</literal> objects in the repository by using <literal>curl http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/trades</literal>, or any specific trade via <literal>curl http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/trades/&lt;trader_id&gt;,&lt;trade_id&gt;</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>The separator between your primary key components, <literal>id</literal> and <literal>trader_id</literal> in this case, is a comma by default, but can be configured to any string not found in your key values by extending the <literal>SpannerKeyIdConverter</literal> class:</simpara>

class MySpecialIdConverter extends SpannerKeyIdConverter {

    @Override
    protected String getUrlIdSeparator() {

<title>Custom types</title>
<simpara>Custom converters can be used extending the type support for user defined types.</simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara>Converters need to implement the <literal>org.springframework.core.convert.converter.Converter</literal> interface in both directions.</simpara>

</orderedlist>
<simpara>For example:</simpara>
<simpara>We would like to have a field of type  <literal>Album</literal> on our <literal>Singer</literal> POJO and want it to be stored as a string property:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Entity

<simpara>Where Album is a simple class:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public class Album {
	String albumName;

	LocalDate date;
}</programlisting>
<simpara>We have to define the two converters:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">	//Converter to write custom Album type

</section>
<section xml:id="_collections_and_arrays">

<simpara>Arrays and collections (types that implement <literal>java.util.Collection</literal>) of supported types are supported.
They are stored as <literal>com.google.cloud.datastore.ListValue</literal>.
Elements are converted to Cloud Datastore supported types individually. <literal>byte[]</literal> is an exception, it is converted to

</section>
<section xml:id="_custom_converter_for_collections">
<title>Custom Converter for collections</title>
<simpara>Users can provide converters from  <literal>List&lt;?&gt;</literal> to the custom collection type.
Only read converter is necessary, the Collection API is used on the write side to convert a collection to the internal list type.</simpara>
<simpara>Collection converters need to implement the <literal>org.springframework.core.convert.converter.Converter</literal> interface.</simpara>
<simpara>Example:</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s improve the Singer class from the previous example.
Instead of a field of type <literal>Album</literal>, we would like to have a field of type <literal>ImmutableSet&lt;Album&gt;</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Entity
public class Singer {

<section xml:id="_relationships_2">
<title>Relationships</title>
<simpara>There are three ways to represent relationships between entities that are described in this section:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Embedded entities stored directly in the field of the containing entity</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>@Descendant</literal> annotated properties for one-to-many relationships</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>@Reference</literal> annotated properties for general relationships without hierarchy</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<section xml:id="_embedded_entities">
<title>Embedded Entities</title>
<simpara>Fields whose types are also annotated with <literal>@Entity</literal> are converted to <literal>EntityValue</literal> and stored inside the parent entity.</simpara>
<simpara>Here is an example of Cloud Datastore entity containing an embedded entity in JSON:</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
  "name" : "Alexander",
  "age" : 47,
  "child" : {"name" : "Philip"  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>This corresponds to a simple pair of Java entities:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">import org.springframework.cloud.gcp.data.datastore.core.mapping.Entity;
import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;

@Entity("parents")
public class Parent {
  @Id
  String name;

  Child child;
}

@Entity
public class Child {
  String name;
}</programlisting>
<simpara><literal>Child</literal> entities are not stored in their own kind.
They are stored in their entirety in the <literal>child</literal> field of the <literal>parents</literal> kind.</simpara>
<simpara>Multiple levels of embedded entities are supported.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Embedded entities don&#8217;t need to have <literal>@Id</literal> field, it is only required for top level entities.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Example:</simpara>
<simpara>Entities can hold embedded entities that are their own type.
We can store trees in Cloud Datastore using this feature:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">import org.springframework.cloud.gcp.data.datastore.core.mapping.Embedded;
import org.springframework.cloud.gcp.data.datastore.core.mapping.Entity;
import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;

@Entity
public class EmbeddableTreeNode {
  @Id
  long value;

  EmbeddableTreeNode left;

  EmbeddableTreeNode right;

  Map&lt;String, Long&gt; longValues;

  Map&lt;String, List&lt;Timestamp&gt;&gt; listTimestamps;

  public EmbeddableTreeNode(long value, EmbeddableTreeNode left, EmbeddableTreeNode right) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}</programlisting>
<section xml:id="_maps">
<title>Maps</title>
<simpara>Maps will be stored as embedded entities where the key values become the field names in the embedded entity.
The value types in these maps can be any regularly supported property type, and the key values will be converted to String using the configured converters.</simpara>
<simpara>Also, a collection of entities can be embedded; it will be converted to <literal>ListValue</literal> on write.</simpara>
<simpara>Example:</simpara>
<simpara>Instead of a binary tree from the previous example, we would like to store a general tree
(each node can have an arbitrary number of children) in Cloud Datastore.
To do that, we need to create a field of type <literal>List&lt;EmbeddableTreeNode&gt;</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">import org.springframework.cloud.gcp.data.datastore.core.mapping.Embedded;
import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;

public class EmbeddableTreeNode {
  @Id
  long value;

  List&lt;EmbeddableTreeNode&gt; children;

  Map&lt;String, EmbeddableTreeNode&gt; siblingNodes;

  Map&lt;String, Set&lt;EmbeddableTreeNode&gt;&gt; subNodeGroups;

  public EmbeddableTreeNode(List&lt;EmbeddableTreeNode&gt; children) {
    this.children = children;
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Because Maps are stored as entities, they can further hold embedded entities:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Singular embedded objects in the value can be stored in the values of embedded Maps.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Collections of embedded objects in the value can also be stored as the values of embedded Maps.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Maps in the value are further stored as embedded entities with the same rules applied recursively for their values.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="_ancestor_descendant_relationships">
<title>Ancestor-Descendant Relationships</title>
<simpara>Parent-child relationships are supported via the <literal>@Descendants</literal> annotation.</simpara>
<simpara>Unlike embedded children, descendants are fully-formed entities residing in their own kinds.
The parent entity does not have an extra field to hold the descendant entities.
Instead, the relationship is captured in the descendants' keys, which refer to their parent entities:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">import org.springframework.cloud.gcp.data.datastore.core.mapping.Descendants;
import org.springframework.cloud.gcp.data.datastore.core.mapping.Entity;
import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;

@Entity("orders")
public class ShoppingOrder {
  @Id
  long id;

  @Descendants
  List&lt;Item&gt; items;
}

@Entity("purchased_item")
public class Item {
  @Id
  Key purchasedItemKey;

  String name;

  Timestamp timeAddedToOrder;
}</programlisting>
<simpara>For example, an instance of a GQL key-literal representation for <literal>Item</literal> would also contain the parent <literal>ShoppingOrder</literal> ID value:</simpara>
<screen>Key(orders, '12345', purchased_item, 'eggs')</screen>
<simpara>The GQL key-literal representation for the parent <literal>ShoppingOrder</literal> would be:</simpara>
<screen>Key(orders, '12345')</screen>
<simpara>The Cloud Datastore entities exist separately in their own kinds.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>ShoppingOrder</literal>:</simpara>
<screen>{
  "id" : 12345
}</screen>
<simpara>The two items inside that order:</simpara>
<screen>{
  "purchasedItemKey" : Key(orders, '12345', purchased_item, 'eggs'),
  "name" : "eggs",
  "timeAddedToOrder" : "2014-09-27 12:30:00.45-8:00"
}

{
  "purchasedItemKey" : Key(orders, '12345', purchased_item, 'sausage'),
  "name" : "sausage",
  "timeAddedToOrder" : "2014-09-28 11:30:00.45-9:00"
}</screen>
<simpara>The parent-child relationship structure of objects is stored in Cloud Datastore using Datastore&#8217;s <link xl:href="https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/entities#ancestor_paths">ancestor relationships</link>.
Because the relationships are defined by the Ancestor mechanism, there is no extra column needed in either the parent or child entity to store this relationship.
The relationship link is part of the descendant entity&#8217;s key value.
These relationships can be many levels deep.</simpara>
<simpara>Properties holding child entities must be collection-like, but they can be any of the supported inter-convertible collection-like types that are supported for regular properties such as <literal>List</literal>, arrays, <literal>Set</literal>, etc&#8230;&#8203;
Child items must have <literal>Key</literal> as their ID type because Cloud Datastore stores the ancestor relationship link inside the keys of the children.</simpara>
<simpara>Reading or saving an entity automatically causes all subsequent levels of children under that entity to be read or saved, respectively.
If a new child is created and added to a property annotated <literal>@Descendants</literal> and the key property is left null, then a new key will be allocated for that child.
The ordering of the retrieved children may not be the same as the ordering in the original property that was saved.</simpara>
<simpara>Child entities cannot be moved from the property of one parent to that of another unless the child&#8217;s key property is set to <literal>null</literal> or a value that contains the new parent as an ancestor.
Since Cloud Datastore entity keys can have multiple parents, it is possible that a child entity appears in the property of multiple parent entities.
Because entity keys are immutable in Cloud Datastore, to change the key of a child you must delete the existing one and re-save it with the new key.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_key_reference_relationships">
<title>Key Reference Relationships</title>
<simpara>General relationships can be stored using the <literal>@Reference</literal> annotation.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">import org.springframework.cloud.gcp.data.datastore.core.mapping.Reference;
import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;

@Entity
public class ShoppingOrder {
  @Id
  long id;

  @Reference
  List&lt;Item&gt; items;

  @Reference
  Item specialSingleItem;
}

@Entity
public class Item {
  @Id
  Key purchasedItemKey;

  String name;

  Timestamp timeAddedToOrder;
}</programlisting>
<simpara><literal>@Reference</literal> relationships are between fully-formed entities residing in their own kinds.
The relationship between <literal>ShoppingOrder</literal> and <literal>Item</literal> entities are stored as a Key field inside <literal>ShoppingOrder</literal>, which are resolved to the underlying Java entity type by Spring Data Cloud Datastore:</simpara>
<screen>{
  "id" : 12345,
  "specialSingleItem" : Key(item, "milk"),
  "items" : [ Key(item, "eggs"), Key(item, "sausage") ]
}</screen>
<simpara>Reference properties can either be singular or collection-like.
These properties correspond to actual columns in the entity and Cloud Datastore Kind that hold the key values of the referenced entities.
The referenced entities are full-fledged entities of other Kinds.</simpara>
<simpara>Similar to the <literal>@Descendants</literal> relationships, reading or writing an entity will recursively read or write all of the referenced entities at all levels.
If referenced entities have <literal>null</literal> ID values, then they will be saved as new entities and will have ID values allocated by Cloud Datastore.
There are no requirements for relationships between the key of an entity and the keys that entity holds as references.
The order of collection-like reference properties is not preserved when reading back from Cloud Datastore.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_datastore_operations_template">
<title>Datastore Operations &amp; Template</title>
<simpara><literal>DatastoreOperations</literal> and its implementation, <literal>DatastoreTemplate</literal>, provides the Template pattern familiar to Spring developers.</simpara>
<simpara>Using the auto-configuration provided by Spring Boot Starter for Datastore, your Spring application context will contain a fully configured <literal>DatastoreTemplate</literal> object that you can autowire in your application:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
public class DatastoreTemplateExample {

	@Autowired
	DatastoreTemplate datastoreTemplate;

	public void doSomething() {
		this.datastoreTemplate.deleteAll(Trader.class);

		Trader t = new Trader();
		//...
		this.datastoreTemplate.save(t);
		//...
		List&lt;Trader&gt; traders = datastoreTemplate.findAll(Trader.class);
		//...
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The Template API provides convenience methods for:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Write operations (saving and deleting)</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Read-write transactions</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<section xml:id="_gql_query">
<title>GQL Query</title>
<simpara>In addition to retrieving entities by their IDs, you can also submit queries.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">  &lt;T&gt; Iterable&lt;T&gt; query(Query&lt;? extends BaseEntity&gt; query, Class&lt;T&gt; entityClass);

  Iterable&lt;Key&gt; queryKeys(Query&lt;Key&gt; query);</programlisting>
<simpara>These methods, respectively, allow querying for:
* entities mapped by a given entity class using all the same mapping and converting features
* arbitrary types produced by a given mapping function
* only the Cloud Datastore keys of the entities found by the query</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_find_by_ids">
<title>Find by ID(s)</title>
<simpara>Datstore reading a single entity or multiple entities in a kind.</simpara>
<simpara>Using <literal>DatastoreTemplate</literal> you can execute reads, for example:</simpara>

List&lt;Trader&gt; traders = this.datastoreTemplate.findAllById(ImmutableList.of("trader1", "trader2"), Trader.class);

List&lt;Trader&gt; allTraders = this.datastoreTemplate.findAll(Trader.class);</programlisting>
<simpara>Cloud Datastore executes key-based reads with strong consistency, but queries with eventual consistency.
In the example above the first two reads utilize keys, while the third is executed using a query based on the corresponding Kind of <literal>Trader</literal>.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_indexes">
<title>Indexes</title>
<simpara>By default, all fields are indexed.
To disable indexing on a particular field, <literal>@Unindexed</literal> annotation can be used.</simpara>

<simpara><link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-commons/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories">Spring Data Repositories</link> are an abstraction that can reduce boilerplate code.</simpara>
<simpara>For example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface TraderRepository extends DatastoreRepository&lt;Trader, String&gt; {
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Spring Data generates a working implementation of the specified interface, which can be autowired into an application.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>Trader</literal> type parameter to <literal>DatastoreRepository</literal> refers to the underlying domain type.
The second type parameter, <literal>String</literal> in this case, refers to the type of the key of the domain type.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public class MyApplication {

	@Autowired
	TraderRepository traderRepository;

	public void demo() {

		this.traderRepository.deleteAll();
		String traderId = "demo_trader";
		Trader t = new Trader();
		t.traderId = traderId;
		this.tradeRepository.save(t);

		Iterable&lt;Trader&gt; allTraders = this.traderRepository.findAll();

		int count = this.traderRepository.count();
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Repositories allow you to define custom Query Methods (detailed in the following sections) for retrieving, counting, and deleting based on filtering and paging parameters.
Filtering parameters can be of types supported by your configured custom converters.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_query_methods_by_convention_2">
<title>Query methods by convention</title>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface TradeRepository extends DatastoreRepository&lt;Trade, String[]&gt; {
  List&lt;Trader&gt; findByAction(String action);

  int countByAction(String action);

  boolean existsByAction(String action);

  List&lt;Trade&gt; findTop3ByActionAndSymbolAndPriceGreaterThanAndPriceLessThanOrEqualOrderBySymbolDesc(
  			String action, String symbol, double priceFloor, double priceCeiling);

  Slice&lt;TestEntity&gt; findBySymbol(String symbol, Pageable pageable);

  List&lt;TestEntity&gt; findBySymbol(String symbol, Sort sort);
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In the example above the <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-commons/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.query-methods">query methods</link> in <literal>TradeRepository</literal> are generated based on the name of the methods using thehttps://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-commons/docs/current/reference/html#repositories.query-methods.query-creation[Spring Data Query creation naming convention].</simpara>
<simpara>Cloud Datastore only supports filter components joined by AND, and the following operations:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>equals</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>greater than or equals</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>greater than</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>less than or equals</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>less than</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>is null</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>After writing a custom repository interface specifying just the signatures of these methods, implementations are generated for you and can be used with an auto-wired instance of the repository.
Because of Cloud Datastore&#8217;s requirement that explicitly selected fields must all appear in a composite index together, <literal>find</literal> name-based query methods are run as <literal>SELECT *</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Delete queries are also supported.
For example, query methods such as <literal>deleteByAction</literal> or <literal>removeByAction</literal> delete entities found by <literal>findByAction</literal>.
Delete queries are executed as separate read and delete operations instead of as a single transaction because Cloud Datastore cannot query in transactions unless ancestors for queries are specified.
As a result, <literal>removeBy</literal> and <literal>deleteBy</literal> name-convention query methods cannot be used inside transactions via either <literal>performInTransaction</literal> or <literal>@Transactional</literal> annotation.</simpara>
<simpara>Delete queries can have the following return types:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>An integer type that is the number of entities deleted</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>A collection of entities that were deleted</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>'void'</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Methods can have <literal>org.springframework.data.domain.Pageable</literal> parameter to control pagination and sorting, or <literal>org.springframework.data.domain.Sort</literal> parameter to control sorting only.
See <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-commons/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.query-methods">Spring Data documentation</link> for details.</simpara>
<simpara>For returning multiple items in a repository method, we support Java collections as well as <literal>org.springframework.data.domain.Page</literal> and <literal>org.springframework.data.domain.Slice</literal>.
If a method&#8217;s return type is <literal>org.springframework.data.domain.Page</literal>, the returned object will include current page, total number of results and total number of pages.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Methods that return <literal>Page</literal> execute an additional query to compute total number of pages.
Methods that return <literal>Slice</literal>, on the other hand, don&#8217;t execute any additional queries and therefore are much more efficient.</simpara>

  @Query("SELECT * FROM  test_entities_ci WHERE id = @id_val")
  TestEntity getOneTestEntity(@Param("id_val") long id);
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The following parameter types are supported:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>com.google.cloud.Timestamp</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>com.google.cloud.datastore.Blob</literal></simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara><literal>java.lang.String</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>enum</literal> values.
These are queried as <literal>String</literal> values.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>With the exception of <literal>Cursor</literal>, array forms of each of the types are also supported.</simpara>
<simpara>If you would like to obtain the count of items of a query or if there are any items returned by the query, set the <literal>count = true</literal> or <literal>exists = true</literal> properties of the <literal>@Query</literal> annotation, respectively.
The return type of the query method in these cases should be an integer type or a boolean type.</simpara>
<simpara>Cloud Datastore provides provides the <literal>SELECT <emphasis>key</emphasis> FROM &#8230;&#8203;</literal> special column for all kinds that retrieves the <literal>Key`s of each row.
Selecting this special `<emphasis>key</emphasis></literal> column is especially useful and efficient for <literal>count</literal> and <literal>exists</literal> queries.</simpara>
<simpara>You can also query for non-entity types:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">	@Query(value = "SELECT __key__ from test_entities_ci")
	List&lt;Key&gt; getKeys();

	@Query(value = "SELECT __key__ from test_entities_ci limit 1")
	Key getKey();

	@Query("SELECT id FROM test_entities_ci WHERE id &lt;= @id_val")
	List&lt;String&gt; getIds(@Param("id_val") long id);

	@Query("SELECT id FROM test_entities_ci WHERE id &lt;= @id_val limit 1")
	String getOneId(@Param("id_val") long id);</programlisting>
<simpara>SpEL can be used to provide GQL parameters:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Query("SELECT * FROM |com.example.Trade| WHERE trades.action = @act
  AND price &gt; :#{#priceRadius * -1} AND price &lt; :#{#priceRadius * 2}")
List&lt;Trade&gt; fetchByActionNamedQuery(@Param("act") String action, @Param("priceRadius") Double r);</programlisting>
<simpara>Kind names can be directly written in the GQL annotations.
Kind names can also be resolved from the <literal>@Entity</literal> annotation on domain classes.</simpara>
<simpara>In this case, the query should refer to table names with fully qualified class names surrounded by <literal>|</literal> characters: <literal>|fully.qualified.ClassName|</literal>.
This is useful when SpEL expressions appear in the kind name provided to the <literal>@Entity</literal> annotation.
For example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Query("SELECT * FROM |com.example.Trade| WHERE trades.action = @act")
List&lt;Trade&gt; fetchByActionNamedQuery(@Param("act") String action);</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_query_methods_with_named_queries_properties_2">
<title>Query methods with named queries properties</title>
<simpara>You can also specify queries with Cloud Datastore parameter tags and SpEL expressions in properties files.</simpara>
<simpara>By default, the <literal>namedQueriesLocation</literal> attribute on <literal>@EnableDatastoreRepositories</literal> points to the <literal>META-INF/datastore-named-queries.properties</literal> file.
You can specify the query for a method in the properties file by providing the GQL as the value for the "interface.method" property:</simpara>
<programlisting language="properties" linenumbering="unnumbered">Trader.fetchByName=SELECT * FROM traders WHERE name = @tag0</programlisting>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface TraderRepository extends DatastoreRepository&lt;Trader, String&gt; {

	// This method uses the query from the properties file instead of one generated based on name.
	List&lt;Trader&gt; fetchByName(@Param("tag0") String traderName);

}</programlisting>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="_transactions_3">
<title>Transactions</title>
<simpara>These transactions work very similarly to those of <literal>DatastoreOperations</literal>, but is specific to the repository&#8217;s domain type and provides repository functions instead of template functions.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, this is a read-write transaction:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowired
DatastoreRepository myRepo;

public String doWorkInsideTransaction() {
  return myRepo.performTransaction(
    transactionDatastoreRepo -&gt; {
      // Work with the single-transaction transactionDatastoreRepo here.
      // This is a DatastoreRepository object.

      return "transaction completed";
    }
  );
}</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_projections_2">
<title>Projections</title>
<simpara>Spring Data Cloud Datastore supports <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-commons/docs/current/reference/html/#projections">projections</link>.
You can define projection interfaces based on domain types and add query methods that return them in your repository:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface TradeProjection {

	String getAction();

	@Value("#{target.symbol + ' ' + target.action}")
	String getSymbolAndAction();
}

public interface TradeRepository extends DatastoreRepository&lt;Trade, Key&gt; {

	List&lt;Trade&gt; findByTraderId(String traderId);

	List&lt;TradeProjection&gt; findByAction(String action);

	@Query("SELECT action, symbol FROM trades WHERE action = @action")
	List&lt;TradeProjection&gt; findByQuery(String action);
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Projections can be provided by name-convention-based query methods as well as by custom GQL queries.
If using custom GQL queries, you can further restrict the fields retrieved from Cloud Datastore to just those required by the projection.
However, custom select statements (those not using <literal>SELECT *</literal>) require composite indexes containing the selected fields.</simpara>
<simpara>Properties of projection types defined using SpEL use the fixed name <literal>target</literal> for the underlying domain object.
As a result, accessing underlying properties take the form <literal>target.&lt;property-name&gt;</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_rest_repositories_2">
<title>REST Repositories</title>
<simpara>When running with Spring Boot, repositories can be exposed as REST services by simply adding this dependency to your pom file:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-data-rest&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>If you prefer to configure parameters (such as path), you can use <literal>@RepositoryRestResource</literal> annotation:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RepositoryRestResource(collectionResourceRel = "trades", path = "trades")
public interface TradeRepository extends DatastoreRepository&lt;Trade, String[]&gt; {
}</programlisting>
<simpara>For example, you can retrieve all <literal>Trade</literal> objects in the repository by using <literal>curl http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/trades</literal>, or any specific trade via <literal>curl http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/trades/&lt;trader_id&gt;</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>You can also write trades using <literal>curl -XPOST -H"Content-Type: application/json" -<link xl:href="mailto:d@test.json">d@test.json</link> http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/trades/</literal> where the file <literal>test.json</literal> holds the JSON representation of a <literal>Trade</literal> object.</simpara>

<simpara>All you have to do is create a Cloud Memorystore instance and use its IP address in <literal>application.properties</literal> file as <literal>spring.redis.host</literal> property value.
Everything else is exactly the same as setting up redis-backed Spring caching.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Memorystore instances and your application instances have to be located in the same region.</simpara>

<simpara><link xl:href="https://cloud.google.com/iap/">Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)</link> provides a security layer over applications deployed to Google Cloud.</simpara>
<simpara>The IAP starter uses <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#oauth2resourceserver">Spring Security OAuth 2.0 Resource Server</link> functionality to automatically extract user identity from the proxy-injected <literal>x-goog-iap-jwt-assertion</literal> HTTP header.</simpara>

</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The audience (<literal>"aud"</literal>) validation is automatically configured when the application is running on App Engine Standard or App Engine Flexible.
For other runtime environments, a custom audience must be provided through <literal>spring.cloud.gcp.security.iap.audience</literal> property.
The custom property, if specified, overrides the automatic App Engine audience detection.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>There is no automatic audience string configuration for Compute Engine or Kubernetes Engine.
To use the IAP starter on GCE/GKE, find the Audience string per instructions in the <link xl:href="https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/signed-headers-howto#verify_the_jwt_payload">Verify the JWT payload</link> guide, and specify it in the <literal>spring.cloud.gcp.security.iap.audience</literal> property.

For each feature type that you provide in the request, <literal>AnnotateImageResponse</literal> provides a getter method to get the result of that feature analysis.
For example, if you analyzed an image using the <literal>LABEL_DETECTION</literal> feature, you would retrieve the results from the response using <literal>annotateImageResponse.getLabelAnnotationsList()</literal>.</simpara>

<title>Cloud Foundry</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud GCP provides support for Cloud Foundry&#8217;s <link xl:href="https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/gcp-sb/index.html">GCP Service Broker</link>.
Our Pub/Sub, Cloud Spanner, Storage, Stackdriver Trace and Cloud SQL MySQL and PostgreSQL starters are Cloud Foundry aware and retrieve properties like project ID, credentials, etc., that are used in auto configuration from the Cloud Foundry environment.</simpara>
<simpara>In cases like Pub/Sub&#8217;s topic and subscription, or Storage&#8217;s bucket name, where those parameters are not used in auto configuration, you can fetch them using the VCAP mapping provided by Spring Boot.
For example, to retrieve the provisioned Pub/Sub topic, you can use the <literal>vcap.services.mypubsub.credentials.topic_name</literal> property from the application environment.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>If the same service is bound to the same application more than once, the auto configuration will not be able to choose among bindings and will not be activated for that service.
This includes both MySQL and PostgreSQL bindings to the same app.</simpara>
</note>
<warning>
<simpara>In order for the Cloud SQL integration to work in Cloud Foundry, auto-reconfiguration must be disabled.
You can do so using the <literal>cf set-env &lt;APP&gt; JBP_CONFIG_SPRING_AUTO_RECONFIGURATION '{enabled: false}'</literal> command.
Otherwise, Cloud Foundry will produce a <literal>DataSource</literal> with an invalid JDBC URL (i.e., <literal>jdbc:mysql://null/null</literal>).</simpara>

<title>Kotlin Support</title>
<simpara>The latest version of the Spring Framework provides first-class support for Kotlin.
For Kotlin users of Spring, the Spring Cloud GCP libraries work out-of-the-box and are fully interoperable with Kotlin applications.</simpara>
<simpara>For more information on building a Spring application in Kotlin, please consult the <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/languages.html#kotlin">Spring Kotlin documentation</link>.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_prerequisites_2">
<title>Prerequisites</title>
<simpara>Ensure that your Kotlin application is properly set up.
Based on your build system, you will need to include the correct Kotlin build plugin in your project:</simpara>

If the property is false (the default), the binder detects a suitable bound service (for example, a RabbitMQ service bound in Cloud Foundry for the RabbitMQ binder) and uses it for creating connections (usually through Spring Cloud Connectors). When set to true, this property instructs binders to completely ignore the bound services and rely on Spring Boot properties (for example, relying on the spring.rabbitmq.* properties provided in the environment for the RabbitMQ binder). The typical usage of this property is to be nested in a customized environment when connecting to multiple systems.</simpara></entry>

If there was a sudden surge of traffic, to 5000 requests per second, you would still end up with 50 traces per second. Conversely, if you had a percentage, like 10%, the same surge would end up with 500 traces per second, possibly overloading your storage.
