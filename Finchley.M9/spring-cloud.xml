<simpara>Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of
the common patterns in distributed systems (e.g. configuration
management, service discovery, circuit breakers, intelligent routing,
micro-proxy, control bus). Coordination of
distributed systems leads to boiler plate patterns, and using Spring
Cloud developers can quickly stand up services and applications that
implement those patterns. They will work well in any distributed
environment, including the developer&#8217;s own laptop, bare metal data
centres, and managed platforms such as Cloud Foundry.</simpara>

<title>Cloud Native Applications</title>
<partintro>
<simpara><link xl:href="http://pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/migrating-to-cloud-native-application-architectures-ebook">Cloud Native</link> is a style of application development that encourages easy adoption of best practices in the areas of continuous delivery and value-driven development.
A related discipline is that of building <link xl:href="http://12factor.net/">12-factor Applications</link>, in which development practices are aligned with delivery and operations goals&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for instance, by using declarative programming and management and monitoring.
Spring Cloud facilitates these styles of development in a number of specific ways.
 The starting point is a set of features to which all components in a distributed system need easy access.</simpara>
<simpara>Many of those features are covered by <link xl:href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot">Spring Boot</link>, on which Spring Cloud builds. Some more features are delivered by Spring Cloud as two libraries: Spring Cloud Context and Spring Cloud Commons.
Spring Cloud Context provides utilities and special services for the <literal>ApplicationContext</literal> of a Spring Cloud application (bootstrap context, encryption, refresh scope, and environment endpoints). Spring Cloud Commons is a set of abstractions and common classes used in different Spring Cloud implementations (such as Spring Cloud Netflix and Spring Cloud Consul).</simpara>
<simpara>If you get an exception due to "Illegal key size" and you use Sun&#8217;s JDK, you need to install the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files.

<chapter xml:id="_spring_cloud_context_application_context_services">
<title>Spring Cloud Context: Application Context Services</title>
<simpara>Spring Boot has an opinionated view of how to build an application with Spring.
For instance, it has conventional locations for common configuration files and has endpoints for common management and monitoring tasks.
Spring Cloud builds on top of that and adds a few features that probably all components in a system would use or occasionally need.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_the_bootstrap_application_context">
<title>The Bootstrap Application Context</title>
<simpara>A Spring Cloud application operates by creating a &#8220;bootstrap&#8221; context, which is a parent context for the main application.
It is responsible for loading configuration properties from the external sources and for decrypting properties in the local external configuration files.
The two contexts share an <literal>Environment</literal>, which is the source of external properties for any Spring application.
By default, bootstrap properties are added with high precedence, so they cannot be overridden by local configuration.</simpara>
<simpara>The bootstrap context uses a different convention for locating external configuration than the main application context.
Instead of <literal>application.yml</literal> (or <literal>.properties</literal>), you can use <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal>, keeping the external configuration for bootstrap and main context
nicely separate.
The following listing shows an example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>bootstrap.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>spring:
  application:
    name: foo
  cloud:
    config:
      uri: ${SPRING_CONFIG_URI:http://localhost:8888}</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>If your application needs any application-specific configuration from the server, it is a good idea to set the <literal>spring.application.name</literal> (in <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal> or <literal>application.yml</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>You can disable the bootstrap process completely by setting <literal>spring.cloud.bootstrap.enabled=false</literal> (for example, in system properties).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_application_context_hierarchies">
<title>Application Context Hierarchies</title>
<simpara>If you build an application context from <literal>SpringApplication</literal> or <literal>SpringApplicationBuilder</literal>, then the Bootstrap context is added as a parent to that context.
It is a feature of Spring that child contexts inherit property sources and profiles from their parent, so the &#8220;main&#8221; application context contains additional property sources, compared to building the same context without Spring Cloud Config.
The additional property sources are:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>&#8220;bootstrap&#8221;: If any <literal>PropertySourceLocators</literal> are found in the Bootstrap context and if they have non-empty properties, an optional <literal>CompositePropertySource</literal> appears with high priority.
An example would be properties from the Spring Cloud Config Server.
See &#8220;<xref linkend="customizing-bootstrap-property-sources"/>&#8221; for instructions on how to customize the contents of this property source.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>&#8220;applicationConfig: [classpath:bootstrap.yml]&#8221; (and related files if Spring profiles are active): If you have a <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal> (or <literal>.properties</literal>), those properties are used to configure the Bootstrap context.
Then they get added to the child context when its parent is set.
They have lower precedence than the <literal>application.yml</literal> (or <literal>.properties</literal>) and any other property sources that are added to the child as a normal part of the process of creating a Spring Boot application.
See &#8220;<xref linkend="customizing-bootstrap-properties"/>&#8221; for instructions on how to customize the contents of these property sources.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Because of the ordering rules of property sources, the &#8220;bootstrap&#8221; entries take precedence.
However, note that these do not contain any data from <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal>, which has very low precedence but can be used to set defaults.</simpara>
<simpara>You can extend the context hierarchy by setting the parent context of any <literal>ApplicationContext</literal> you create&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for example, by using its own interface or with the <literal>SpringApplicationBuilder</literal> convenience methods (<literal>parent()</literal>, <literal>child()</literal> and <literal>sibling()</literal>).
The bootstrap context is the parent of the most senior ancestor that you create yourself.
Every context in the hierarchy has its own &#8220;bootstrap&#8221; (possibly empty) property source to avoid promoting values inadvertently from parents down to their descendants.
If there is a Config Server, every context in the hierarchy can also (in principle) have a different <literal>spring.application.name</literal> and, hence, a different remote property source.
Normal Spring application context behavior rules apply to property resolution: properties from a child context override those in
the parent, by name and also by property source name.
(If the child has a property source with the same name as the parent, the value from the parent is not included in the child).</simpara>
<simpara>Note that the <literal>SpringApplicationBuilder</literal> lets you share an <literal>Environment</literal> amongst the whole hierarchy, but that is not the default.
Thus, sibling contexts, in particular, do not need to have the same profiles or property sources, even though they may share common values with their parent.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="customizing-bootstrap-properties">
<title>Changing the Location of Bootstrap Properties</title>
<simpara>The <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal> (or <literal>.properties</literal>) location can be specified by setting <literal>spring.cloud.bootstrap.name</literal> (default: <literal>bootstrap</literal>) or <literal>spring.cloud.bootstrap.location</literal> (default: empty)&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for example, in System properties.
Those properties behave like the <literal>spring.config.*</literal> variants with the same name.
In fact, they are used to set up the bootstrap <literal>ApplicationContext</literal> by setting those properties in its <literal>Environment</literal>.
If there is an active profile (from <literal>spring.profiles.active</literal> or through the <literal>Environment</literal> API in the
context you are building), properties in that profile get loaded as well, the same as in a regular Spring Boot app&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for example, from <literal>bootstrap-development.properties</literal> for a <literal>development</literal> profile.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="overriding-bootstrap-properties">
<title>Overriding the Values of Remote Properties</title>
<simpara>The property sources that are added to your application by the bootstrap context are often &#8220;remote&#8221; (from example, from Spring Cloud Config Server).
By default, they cannot be overridden locally, except on the command line.
If you want to let your applications override the remote properties with their own System properties or config files, the remote property source has to grant it permission by setting <literal>spring.cloud.config.allowOverride=true</literal> (it does not work to set this locally).
Once that flag is set, two finer-grained settings control the location of the remote properties in relation to system properties and the application&#8217;s local configuration:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>spring.cloud.config.overrideNone=true</literal>: Override from any local property source.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>spring.cloud.config.overrideSystemProperties=false</literal>: Only system properties and environment variables (but not the local config files) should override the remote settings.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>
<section xml:id="_customizing_the_bootstrap_configuration">
<title>Customizing the Bootstrap Configuration</title>
<simpara>The bootstrap context can be set to do anything you like by adding entries to <literal>/META-INF/spring.factories</literal> under a key named <literal>org.springframework.cloud.bootstrap.BootstrapConfiguration</literal>.
This holds a comma-separated list of Spring <literal>@Configuration</literal> classes that are used to create the context.
Any beans that you want to be available to the main application context for autowiring can be created here.
There is a special contract for <literal>@Beans</literal> of type <literal>ApplicationContextInitializer</literal>.
If you want to control the startup sequence, classes can be marked with an <literal>@Order</literal> annotation (the default order is <literal>last</literal>).</simpara>
<warning>
<simpara>When adding custom <literal>BootstrapConfiguration</literal>, be careful that the classes you add are not <literal>@ComponentScanned</literal> by mistake into your &#8220;main&#8221; application context, where they might not be needed.
Use a separate package name for boot configuration classes and make sure that name is not already covered by your <literal>@ComponentScan</literal> or <literal>@SpringBootApplication</literal> annotated configuration classes.</simpara>
</warning>
<simpara>The bootstrap process ends by injecting initializers into the main <literal>SpringApplication</literal> instance (which is the normal Spring Boot startup sequence, whether it is running as a standalone application or deployed in an application server).
First, a bootstrap context is created from the classes found in <literal>spring.factories</literal>.
Then, all <literal>@Beans</literal> of type <literal>ApplicationContextInitializer</literal> are added to the main <literal>SpringApplication</literal> before it is started.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="customizing-bootstrap-property-sources">
<title>Customizing the Bootstrap Property Sources</title>
<simpara>The default property source for external configuration added by the bootstrap process is the Spring Cloud Config Server, but you can add additional sources by adding beans of type <literal>PropertySourceLocator</literal> to the bootstrap context (through <literal>spring.factories</literal>).
For instance, you can insert additional properties from a different server or from a database.</simpara>
<simpara>As an example, consider the following custom locator:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Configuration
public class CustomPropertySourceLocator implements PropertySourceLocator {

    @Override
    public PropertySource&lt;?&gt; locate(Environment environment) {
        return new MapPropertySource("customProperty",
                Collections.&lt;String, Object&gt;singletonMap("property.from.sample.custom.source", "worked as intended"));
    }

}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>Environment</literal> that is passed in is the one for the <literal>ApplicationContext</literal> about to be created&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;in other words, the one for which we supply additional property sources for.
It already has its normal Spring Boot-provided property sources, so you can use those to locate a property source specific to this <literal>Environment</literal> (for example, by keying it on <literal>spring.application.name</literal>, as is done in the default Spring Cloud Config Server property source locator).</simpara>
<simpara>If you create a jar with this class in it and then add a <literal>META-INF/spring.factories</literal> containing the following, the <literal>customProperty</literal> <literal>PropertySource</literal> appears in any application that includes that jar on its classpath:</simpara>
<screen>org.springframework.cloud.bootstrap.BootstrapConfiguration=sample.custom.CustomPropertySourceLocator</screen>
</section>
<section xml:id="_environment_changes">
<title>Environment Changes</title>
<simpara>The application listens for an <literal>EnvironmentChangeEvent</literal> and reacts to the change in a couple of standard ways (additional <literal>ApplicationListeners</literal> can be added as <literal>@Beans</literal> by the user in the normal way).
When an <literal>EnvironmentChangeEvent</literal> is observed, it has a list of key values that have changed, and the application uses those to:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Re-bind any <literal>@ConfigurationProperties</literal> beans in the context</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Set the logger levels for any properties in <literal>logging.level.*</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Note that the Config Client does not, by default, poll for changes in the <literal>Environment</literal>.
Generally, we would not recommend that approach for detecting changes (although you could set it up with a
<literal>@Scheduled</literal> annotation).
If you have a scaled-out client application, it is better to broadcast the <literal>EnvironmentChangeEvent</literal> to all the instances instead of having them polling for changes (for example, by using the <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-bus">Spring Cloud Bus</link>).</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>EnvironmentChangeEvent</literal> covers a large class of refresh use cases, as long as you can actually make a change to the <literal>Environment</literal> and publish the event.
Note that those APIs are public and part of core Spring).
You can verify that the changes are bound to <literal>@ConfigurationProperties</literal> beans by visiting the <literal>/configprops</literal> endpoint (a normal Spring Boot Actuator feature).
For instance, a <literal>DataSource</literal> can have its <literal>maxPoolSize</literal> changed at runtime (the default <literal>DataSource</literal> created by Spring Boot is an <literal>@ConfigurationProperties</literal> bean) and grow capacity dynamically.
Re-binding <literal>@ConfigurationProperties</literal> does not cover another large class of use cases, where you need more control over the refresh and where you need a change to be atomic over the whole <literal>ApplicationContext</literal>.
To address those concerns, we have <literal>@RefreshScope</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_refresh_scope">
<title>Refresh Scope</title>
<simpara>When there is a configuration change, a Spring <literal>@Bean</literal> that is marked as <literal>@RefreshScope</literal> gets special treatment.
This feature addresses the problem of stateful beans that only get their configuration injected when they are initialized.
For instance, if a <literal>DataSource</literal> has open connections when the database URL is changed via the <literal>Environment</literal>, you probably want the holders of those connections to be able to complete what they are doing.
Then, the next time something borrows a connection from the pool, it gets one with the new URL.</simpara>
<simpara>Refresh scope beans are lazy proxies that initialize when they are used (that is, when a method is called), and the scope acts as a cache of initialized values.
To force a bean to re-initialize on the next method call, you must invalidate its cache entry.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>RefreshScope</literal> is a bean in the context and has a public  <literal>refreshAll()</literal> method to refresh all beans in the scope by clearing the target cache.
The <literal>/refresh</literal> endpoint exposes this functionality (over HTTP or JMX).
To refresh an individual bean by name, there is also a <literal>refresh(String)</literal> method.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara><literal>@RefreshScope</literal> works (technically) on an <literal>@Configuration</literal> class, but it might lead to surprising behavior.
For example, it does <emphasis role="strong">not</emphasis> mean that all the <literal>@Beans</literal> defined in that class are themselves in <literal>@RefreshScope</literal>.
Specifically, anything that depends on those beans cannot rely on them being updated when a refresh is initiated, unless it is itself in <literal>@RefreshScope</literal>.
In that case, it is rebuilt on a refresh and its dependencies are re-injected. At that point, they are re-initialized from the refreshed <literal>@Configuration</literal>).</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_encryption_and_decryption">
<title>Encryption and Decryption</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud has an <literal>Environment</literal> pre-processor for decrypting property values locally.
It follows the same rules as the Config Server and has the same external configuration through <literal>encrypt.*</literal>.
Thus, you can use encrypted values in the form of <literal>{cipher}*</literal> and, as long as there is a valid key, they are decrypted before the main application context gets the <literal>Environment</literal> settings.
To use the encryption features in an application, you need to include Spring Security RSA in your classpath (Maven co-ordinates: "org.springframework.security:spring-security-rsa"), and you also need the full strength JCE extensions in your JVM.</simpara>
<simpara>If you get an exception due to "Illegal key size" and you use Sun&#8217;s JDK, you need to install the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files.

<section xml:id="__enablediscoveryclient">
<title>@EnableDiscoveryClient</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Commons provides the <literal>@EnableDiscoveryClient</literal> annotation.
This looks for implementations of the <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> interface with <literal>META-INF/spring.factories</literal>.
Implementations of the Discovery Client add a configuration class to <literal>spring.factories</literal> under the <literal>org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient</literal> key.
Examples of <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> implementations include <link xl:href="http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/">Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka</link>, <link xl:href="http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-consul/">Spring Cloud Consul Discovery</link>, and <link xl:href="http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-zookeeper/">Spring Cloud Zookeeper Discovery</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>By default, implementations of <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> auto-register the local Spring Boot server with the remote discovery server.
This behavior can be disabled by setting <literal>autoRegister=false</literal> in <literal>@EnableDiscoveryClient</literal>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara><literal>@EnableDiscoveryClient</literal> is no longer required.
You can put a <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> implementation on the classpath to cause the Spring Boot application to register with the service discovery server.</simpara>

<title>Retrying Failed Requests</title>
<simpara>A load-balanced <literal>RestTemplate</literal> can be configured to retry failed requests.
By default, this logic is disabled.
You can enable it by adding <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry">Spring Retry</link> to your application&#8217;s classpath.
The load-balanced <literal>RestTemplate</literal> honors some of the Ribbon configuration values related to retrying failed requests.
You can use <literal>client.ribbon.MaxAutoRetries</literal>, <literal>client.ribbon.MaxAutoRetriesNextServer</literal>, and <literal>client.ribbon.OkToRetryOnAllOperations</literal> properties.
If you would like to disable the retry logic with Spring Retry on the classpath, you can set <literal>spring.cloud.loadbalancer.retry.enabled=false</literal>.
See the <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon/wiki/Getting-Started#the-properties-file-sample-clientproperties">Ribbon documentation</link> for a description of what these properties do.</simpara>
<simpara>If you would like to implement a <literal>BackOffPolicy</literal> in your retries, you need to create a bean of type <literal>LoadBalancedBackOffPolicyFactory</literal> and return the <literal>BackOffPolicy</literal> you would like to use for a given service, as shown in the following example:</simpara>

<title>Spring Cloud Config</title>
<partintro>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">1.3.5.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Config provides server-side and client-side support for externalized configuration in a distributed system. With the Config Server, you have a central place to manage external properties for applications across all environments.
The concepts on both client and server map identically to the Spring <literal>Environment</literal> and <literal>PropertySource</literal> abstractions, so they fit very well with Spring applications but can be used with any application running in any language.
As an application moves through the deployment pipeline from dev to test and into production, you can manage the configuration between those environments and be certain that applications have everything they need to run when they migrate.
The default implementation of the server storage backend uses git, so it easily supports labelled versions of configuration environments as well as being accessible to a wide range of tooling for managing the content.
It is easy to add alternative implementations and plug them in with Spring configuration.</simpara>
</partintro>
<chapter xml:id="_quick_start">
<title>Quick Start</title>
<simpara>This quick start walks through using both the server and the client of Spring Cloud Config Server.</simpara>
<simpara>First, start the server, as follows:</simpara>
<screen>$ cd spring-cloud-config-server
$ ../mvnw spring-boot:run</screen>
<simpara>The server is a Spring Boot application, so you can run it from your IDE if you prefer to do so (the main class is <literal>ConfigServerApplication</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>Next try out a client, as follows:</simpara>
<screen>$ curl localhost:8888/foo/development
{"name":"foo","label":"master","propertySources":[
  {"name":"https://github.com/scratches/config-repo/foo-development.properties","source":{"bar":"spam"}},
  {"name":"https://github.com/scratches/config-repo/foo.properties","source":{"foo":"bar"}}
]}</screen>
<simpara>The default strategy for locating property sources is to clone a git repository (at <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri</literal>) and use it to initialize a mini <literal>SpringApplication</literal>.
The mini-application&#8217;s <literal>Environment</literal> is used to enumerate property sources and publish them at a JSON endpoint.</simpara>
<simpara>The HTTP service has resources in the following form:</simpara>
<screen>/{application}/{profile}[/{label}]
/{application}-{profile}.yml
/{label}/{application}-{profile}.yml
/{application}-{profile}.properties
/{label}/{application}-{profile}.properties</screen>
<simpara>where <literal>application</literal> is injected as the <literal>spring.config.name</literal> in the <literal>SpringApplication</literal> (what is normally <literal>application</literal> in a regular Spring Boot app), <literal>profile</literal> is an active profile (or comma-separated list of properties), and <literal>label</literal> is an optional git label (defaults to <literal>master</literal>.)</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Config Server pulls configuration for remote clients from a git repository (which must be provided), as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo</programlisting>
<section xml:id="_client_side_usage">
<title>Client Side Usage</title>
<simpara>To use these features in an application, you can build it as a Spring Boot application that depends on spring-cloud-config-client (for an example, see the test cases for the config-client or the sample application).
The most convenient way to add the dependency is with a Spring Boot starter <literal>org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-config</literal>.
There is also a parent pom and BOM (<literal>spring-cloud-starter-parent</literal>) for Maven users and a Spring IO version management properties file for Gradle and Spring CLI users. The following example shows a typical Maven configuration:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>pom.xml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">   &lt;parent&gt;
       &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
       &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-parent&lt;/artifactId&gt;
       &lt;version&gt;{spring-boot-docs-version}&lt;/version&gt;
       &lt;relativePath /&gt; &lt;!-- lookup parent from repository --&gt;
   &lt;/parent&gt;

&lt;dependencyManagement&gt;
	&lt;dependencies&gt;
		&lt;dependency&gt;
			&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
			&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-dependencies&lt;/artifactId&gt;
			&lt;version&gt;{spring-cloud-version}&lt;/version&gt;
			&lt;type&gt;pom&lt;/type&gt;
			&lt;scope&gt;import&lt;/scope&gt;
		&lt;/dependency&gt;
	&lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;

&lt;dependencies&gt;
	&lt;dependency&gt;
		&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
		&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-starter-config&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;/dependency&gt;
	&lt;dependency&gt;
		&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
		&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-test&lt;/artifactId&gt;
		&lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
	&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;/dependencies&gt;

&lt;build&gt;
	&lt;plugins&gt;
           &lt;plugin&gt;
               &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
               &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
           &lt;/plugin&gt;
	&lt;/plugins&gt;
&lt;/build&gt;

   &lt;!-- repositories also needed for snapshots and milestones --&gt;</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Now you can create a standard Spring Boot application, such as the following HTTP server:</simpara>
<screen>@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class Application {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

}</screen>
<simpara>When this HTTP server runs, it picks up the external configuration from the default local config server (if it is running) on port 8888.
To modify the startup behavior, you can change the location of the config server by using <literal>bootstrap.properties</literal> (similar to <literal>application.properties</literal> but for the bootstrap phase of an application context), as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.config.uri: http://myconfigserver.com</screen>
<simpara>The bootstrap properties show up in the <literal>/env</literal> endpoint as a high-priority property source, as shown in the following example.</simpara>
<screen>$ curl localhost:8080/env
{
  "profiles":[],
  "configService:https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo/bar.properties":{"foo":"bar"},
  "servletContextInitParams":{},
  "systemProperties":{...},
  ...
}</screen>
<simpara>A property source called <literal>``configService:&lt;URL of remote repository&gt;/&lt;file name&gt;</literal> contains the <literal>foo</literal> property with a value of <literal>bar</literal> and is highest priority.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The URL in the property source name is the git repository, not the config server URL.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_spring_cloud_config_server">
<title>Spring Cloud Config Server</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Config Server provides an HTTP resource-based API for external configuration (name-value pairs or equivalent YAML content).
The server is embeddable in a Spring Boot application, by using the <literal>@EnableConfigServer</literal> annotation.
Consequently, the following application is a config server:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>ConfigServer.java</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@EnableConfigServer
public class ConfigServer {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(ConfigServer.class, args);
  }
}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Like all Spring Boot applications, it runs on port 8080 by default, but you can switch it to the more conventional port 8888 in various ways.
The easiest, which also sets a default configuration repository, is by launching it with <literal>spring.config.name=configserver</literal> (there is a <literal>configserver.yml</literal> in the Config Server jar).
Another is to use your own <literal>application.properties</literal>, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.properties</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="properties" linenumbering="unnumbered">server.port: 8888
spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri: file://${user.home}/config-repo</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>where <literal>${user.home}/config-repo</literal> is a git repository containing YAML and properties files.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>On Windows, you need an extra "/" in the file URL if it is absolute with a drive prefix (for example,<literal><link xl:href="file:///${user.home}/config-repo">file:///${user.home}/config-repo</link></literal>).</simpara>
</note>
<tip>
<simpara>The following listing shows a recipe for creating the git repository in the preceding example:</simpara>
<screen>$ cd $HOME
$ mkdir config-repo
$ cd config-repo
$ git init .
$ echo info.foo: bar &gt; application.properties
$ git add -A .
$ git commit -m "Add application.properties"</screen>
</tip>
<warning>
<simpara>Using the local filesystem for your git repository is intended for testing only.
You should use a server to host your configuration repositories in production.</simpara>
</warning>
<warning>
<simpara>The initial clone of your configuration repository can be quick and efficient if you keep only text files in it.
If you store binary files, especially large ones, you may experience delays on the first request for configuration or encounter out of memory errors in the server.</simpara>
</warning>
<section xml:id="_environment_repository">
<title>Environment Repository</title>
<simpara>Where should you store the configuration data for the Config Server?
The strategy that governs this behaviour is the <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal>, serving <literal>Environment</literal> objects.
This <literal>Environment</literal> is a shallow copy of the domain from the Spring <literal>Environment</literal> (including <literal>propertySources</literal> as the main feature).
The <literal>Environment</literal> resources are parametrized by three variables:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>{application}</literal>, which maps to <literal>spring.application.name</literal> on the client side.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>{profile}</literal>, which maps to <literal>spring.profiles.active</literal> on the client (comma-separated list).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>{label}</literal>, which is a server side feature labelling a "versioned" set of config files.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Repository implementations generally behave like a Spring Boot application, loading configuration files from a <literal>spring.config.name</literal> equal to the <literal>{application}</literal> parameter, and <literal>spring.profiles.active</literal> equal to the <literal>{profiles}</literal> parameter.
Precedence rules for profiles are also the same as in a regular Spring Boot application: Active profiles take precedence over defaults, and, if there are multiple profiles, the last one wins (similar to adding entries to a <literal>Map</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>The following sample client application has this bootstrap configuration:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>bootstrap.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  application:
    name: foo
  profiles:
    active: dev,mysql</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>(As usual with a Spring Boot application, these properties could also be set by environment variables or command line arguments).</simpara>
<simpara>If the repository is file-based, the server creates an
<literal>Environment</literal> from <literal>application.yml</literal> (shared between all clients) and
<literal>foo.yml</literal> (with <literal>foo.yml</literal> taking precedence).
If the YAML files have documents inside them that point to Spring profiles, those are applied with higher precedence (in order of the profiles listed).
If there are profile-specific YAML (or properties) files, these are also applied with higher precedence than the defaults.
Higher precedence translates to a <literal>PropertySource</literal> listed earlier in the <literal>Environment</literal>.
(These same rules apply in a standalone Spring Boot application.)</simpara>
<section xml:id="_git_backend">
<title>Git Backend</title>
<simpara>The default implementation of <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> uses a Git backend, which is very convenient for managing upgrades and physical
environments and for auditing changes.
To change the location of the repository, you can set the <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri</literal> configuration property in the Config Server (for example in <literal>application.yml</literal>).
If you set it with a <literal>file:</literal> prefix, it should work from a local repository so that you can get started quickly and easily without a server. However, in that case, the server operates directly on the local repository without cloning it (it does not matter if it is not bare because the Config Server never makes changes to the "remote" repository).
To scale the Config Server up and make it highly available, you need to have all instances of the server pointing to the same repository, so only a shared file system would work.
Even in that case, it is better to use the <literal>ssh:</literal> protocol for a shared filesystem repository, so that the server can clone it and use a local working copy as a cache.</simpara>
<simpara>This repository implementation maps the <literal>{label}</literal> parameter of the HTTP resource to a git label (commit id, branch name, or tag).
If the git branch or tag name contains a slash (<literal>/</literal>), then the label in the HTTP URL should instead be specified with the special string <literal>$$_$$</literal> (to avoid ambiguity with other URL paths).
For example, if the label is <literal>foo/bar</literal>, replacing the slash would result in the following label: <literal>foo($$_$$)bar</literal>.
The inclusion of the special string <literal>($$_$$)</literal> can also be applied to the <literal>{application}</literal> parameter.
If you use a command-line client such as curl, be careful with the brackets in the URL&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;you should
escape them from the shell with single quotes ('').</simpara>
<section xml:id="_placeholders_in_git_uri">
<title>Placeholders in Git URI</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Config Server supports a git repository URL with placeholders for the <literal>{application}</literal> and <literal>{profile}</literal> (and <literal>{label}</literal> if you need it, but remember that the label is applied as a git label anyway).
So you can support a &#8220;one repository per application&#8221; policy by using a structure similar to the following:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/myorg/{application}</programlisting>
<simpara>You can also support a &#8220;one repository per profile&#8221; policy by using a similar pattern but with
<literal>{profile}</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Additionally, using the special string "($$_$$)" within your <literal>{application}</literal> parameters can enable support for multiple
organizations, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/{application}</programlisting>
<simpara>where <literal>{application}</literal> is provided at request time in the following format: <literal>organization($$_$$)application</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_pattern_matching_and_multiple_repositories">
<title>Pattern Matching and Multiple Repositories</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Config also includes support for more complex requirements with pattern
matching on the application and profile name.
The pattern format is a comma-separated list of <literal>{application}/{profile}</literal> names with wildcards (note that a pattern beginning with a wildcard may need to be quoted), as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          repos:
            simple: https://github.com/simple/config-repo
            special:
              pattern: special*/dev*,*special*/dev*
              uri: https://github.com/special/config-repo
            local:
              pattern: local*
              uri: file:/home/configsvc/config-repo</programlisting>
<simpara>If <literal>{application}/{profile}</literal> does not match any of the patterns, it uses the default URI defined under <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri</literal>.
In the above example, for the &#8220;simple&#8221; repository, the pattern is <literal>simple/*</literal> (it only matches one application named <literal>simple</literal> in all profiles). The &#8220;local&#8221; repository matches all application names beginning with <literal>local</literal> in all profiles (the <literal>/*</literal> suffix is added automatically to any pattern that does not have a profile matcher).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The &#8220;one-liner&#8221; short cut used in the &#8220;simple&#8221; example can be used only if the only property to be set is the URI.
If you need to set anything else (credentials, pattern, and so on) you need to use the full form.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>The <literal>pattern</literal> property in the repo is actually an array, so you can use a YAML array (or <literal>[0]</literal>, <literal>[1]</literal>, etc. suffixes in properties files) to bind to multiple patterns.
You may need to do so if you are going to run apps with multiple profiles, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          repos:
            development:
              pattern:
                - '*/development'
                - '*/staging'
              uri: https://github.com/development/config-repo
            staging:
              pattern:
                - '*/qa'
                - '*/production'
              uri: https://github.com/staging/config-repo</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>Spring Cloud guesses that a pattern containing a profile that does not end in <literal>*</literal> implies that you actually want to match a list of profiles starting with this pattern (so <literal>*/staging</literal> is a shortcut for <literal>["*/staging", "*/staging,*"]</literal>, and so on).
This is common where, for instance, you need to run applications in the &#8220;development&#8221; profile locally but also the &#8220;cloud&#8221; profile remotely.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Every repository can also optionally store config files in sub-directories, and patterns to search for those directories can be specified as <literal>searchPaths</literal>.
The following example shows a config file at the top level:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          searchPaths: foo,bar*</programlisting>
<simpara>In the preceding example, the server searches for config files in the top level and in the <literal>foo/</literal> sub-directory and also any sub-directory whose name begins with <literal>bar</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>By default, the server clones remote repositories when configuration
is first requested.
The server can be configured to clone the repositories at startup, as shown in the following top-level example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://git/common/config-repo.git
          repos:
            team-a:
                pattern: team-a-*
                cloneOnStart: true
                uri: http://git/team-a/config-repo.git
            team-b:
                pattern: team-b-*
                cloneOnStart: false
                uri: http://git/team-b/config-repo.git
            team-c:
                pattern: team-c-*
                uri: http://git/team-a/config-repo.git</programlisting>
<simpara>In the preceding example, the server clones team-a&#8217;s config-repo on startup, before it
accepts any requests.
All other repositories are not cloned until configuration from the repository is requested.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Setting a repository to be cloned when the Config Server starts up can help to identify a misconfigured configuration source (such as an invalid repository URI) quickly, while the Config Server is starting up.
With <literal>cloneOnStart</literal> not enabled for a configuration source, the Config Server may start successfully with a misconfigured or invalid configuration source and not detect an error until an application requests configuration from that configuration source.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_authentication">
<title>Authentication</title>
<simpara>To use HTTP basic authentication on the remote repository, add the <literal>username</literal> and <literal>password</literal> properties separately (not in the URL), as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          username: trolley
          password: strongpassword</programlisting>
<simpara>If you do not use HTTPS and user credentials, SSH should also work out of the box when you store keys in the default directories (<literal>~/.ssh</literal>) and the URI points to an SSH location, such as <literal>git@github.com:configuration/cloud-configuration</literal>.
It is important that an entry for the Git server be present in the <literal>~/.ssh/known_hosts</literal> file and that it is in <literal>ssh-rsa</literal> format.
Other formats (such as <literal>ecdsa-sha2-nistp256</literal>) are not supported.
To avoid surprises, you should ensure that only one entry is present in the <literal>known_hosts</literal> file for the Git server and that it matches the URL you provided to the config server.
If you use a hostname in the URL, you want to have exactly that (not the IP) in the <literal>known_hosts</literal> file.
The repository is accessed by using JGit, so any documentation you find on that should be applicable.
HTTPS proxy settings can be set in <literal>~/.git/config</literal> or (in the same way as for any other JVM process) with
system properties (<literal>-Dhttps.proxyHost</literal> and <literal>-Dhttps.proxyPort</literal>).</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>If you do not know where your <literal>~/.git</literal> directory is, use <literal>git config --global</literal> to manipulate the settings (for example, <literal>git config --global http.sslVerify false</literal>).</simpara>
</tip>
</section>
<section xml:id="_authentication_with_aws_codecommit">
<title>Authentication with AWS CodeCommit</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Config Server also supports <link xl:href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/welcome.html">AWS CodeCommit</link> authentication.
AWS CodeCommit uses an authentication helper when using Git from the command line.
This helper is not used with the JGit library, so a JGit CredentialProvider for AWS CodeCommit is created if the Git URI matches the AWS CodeCommit pattern.
AWS CodeCommit URIs follow this pattern://git-codecommit.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/${repopath}.</simpara>
<simpara>If you provide a username and password with an AWS CodeCommit URI, they must be the <link xl:href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSGettingStartedGuide/AWSCredentials.html">AWS accessKeyId and secretAccessKey</link> that provide access to the repository.
If you do not specify a username and password, the accessKeyId and secretAccessKey are retrieved by using the <link xl:href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html">AWS Default Credential Provider Chain</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>If your Git URI matches the CodeCommit URI pattern (shown earlier), you must provide valid AWS credentials in the username and password or in one of the locations supported by the default credential provider chain.
AWS EC2 instances may use <link xl:href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html">IAM Roles for EC2 Instances</link>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The <literal>aws-java-sdk-core</literal> jar is an optional dependency.
If the <literal>aws-java-sdk-core</literal> jar is not on your classpath, the AWS Code Commit credential provider is not created, regardless of the git server URI.</simpara>
</note>

<section xml:id="_git_ssh_configuration_using_properties">
<title>Git SSH configuration using properties</title>
<simpara>By default, the JGit library used by Spring Cloud Config Server uses SSH configuration files such as <literal>~/.ssh/known_hosts</literal> and <literal>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</literal> when connecting to Git repositories by using an SSH URI.
In cloud environments such as Cloud Foundry, the local filesystem may be ephemeral or not easily accessible.
For those cases, SSH configuration can be set by using Java properties.
In order to activate property-based SSH configuration, the <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.git.ignoreLocalSshSettings</literal> property must be set to <literal>true</literal>, as shown in the following example:</simpara>

<simpara>The preceding listing causes a search of the repository for files in the same name as the directory (as well as the top level).
Wildcards are also valid in a search path with placeholders (any matching directory is included in the search).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_force_pull_in_git_repositories">
<title>Force pull in Git Repositories</title>
<simpara>As mentioned earlier, Spring Cloud Config Server makes a clone of the remote git repository in case the local copy gets dirty (for example,

<simpara>To solve this issue, there is a <literal>force-pull</literal> property that makes Spring Cloud Config Server force pull from the remote repository if the local copy is dirty, as shown in the following example:</simpara>

<section xml:id="_deleting_untracked_branches_in_git_repositories">
<title>Deleting untracked branches in Git Repositories</title>
<simpara>As Spring Cloud Config Server has a clone of the remote git repository
after check-outing branch to local repo (e.g fetching properties by label) it will keep this branch
forever or till the next server restart (which creates new local repo).
So there could be a case when remote branch is deleted but local copy of it is still available for fetching.
And if Spring Cloud Config Server client service starts with <literal>--spring.cloud.config.label=deletedRemoteBranch,master</literal>
it will fetch properties from <literal>deletedRemoteBranch</literal> local branch, but not from <literal>master</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>In order to keep local repository branches clean and up to remote - <literal>deleteUntrackedBranches</literal> property could be set.
It will make Spring Cloud Config Server <emphasis role="strong">force</emphasis> delete untracked branches from local repository.
Example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:

    config:
      server:

<section xml:id="_version_control_backend_filesystem_use">
<title>Version Control Backend Filesystem Use</title>
<warning>
<simpara>With VCS-based backends (git, svn), files are checked out or cloned to the local filesystem.
By default, they are put in the system temporary directory with a prefix of <literal>config-repo-</literal>.
On linux, for example, it could be <literal>/tmp/config-repo-&lt;randomid&gt;</literal>.
Some operating systems <link xl:href="http://serverfault.com/questions/377348/when-does-tmp-get-cleared/377349#377349">routinely clean out</link> temporary directories.
This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as missing properties.
To avoid this problem, change the directory that Config Server uses by setting <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.git.basedir</literal> or <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.svn.basedir</literal> to a directory that does not reside in the system temp structure.</simpara>
</warning>
</section>
<section xml:id="_file_system_backend">
<title>File System Backend</title>
<simpara>There is also a &#8220;native&#8221; profile in the Config Server that does not use Git but loads the config files from the local classpath or file system (any static URL you want to point to with <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.native.searchLocations</literal>).
To use the native profile, launch the Config Server with <literal>spring.profiles.active=native</literal>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Remember to use the <literal>file:</literal> prefix for file resources (the default without a prefix is usually the classpath).
As with any Spring Boot configuration, you can embed <literal>${}</literal>-style environment placeholders, but remember that absolute paths in Windows require an extra <literal>/</literal> (for example, <literal><link xl:href="file:///${user.home}/config-repo">file:///${user.home}/config-repo</link></literal>).</simpara>
</note>
<warning>
<simpara>The default value of the <literal>searchLocations</literal> is identical to a local Spring Boot application (that is, <literal>[classpath:/, classpath:/config,
file:./, file:./config]</literal>).
This does not expose the <literal>application.properties</literal> from the server to all clients, because any property sources present in the server are removed before being sent to the client.</simpara>

<simpara>A filesystem backend is great for getting started quickly and for testing.
To use it in production, you need to be sure that the file system is reliable and shared across all instances of the Config Server.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>The search locations can contain placeholders for <literal>{application}</literal>, <literal>{profile}</literal>, and <literal>{label}</literal>.
In this way, you can segregate the directories in the path and choose a strategy that makes sense for you (such as subdirectory per application or subdirectory per profile).</simpara>
<simpara>If you do not use placeholders in the search locations, this repository also appends the <literal>{label}</literal> parameter of the HTTP resource to a suffix on the search path, so properties files are loaded from each search location <emphasis role="strong">and</emphasis> a subdirectory with the same name as the label (the labelled properties take precedence in the Spring Environment).
Thus, the default behaviour with no placeholders is the same as adding a search location ending with <literal>/{label}/</literal>.
For example, <literal>file:/tmp/config</literal> is the same as <literal>file:/tmp/config,file:/tmp/config/{label}</literal>.
This behavior can be disabled by setting <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.native.addLabelLocations=false</literal>.</simpara>

<title>Vault Backend</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Config Server also supports <link xl:href="https://www.vaultproject.io">Vault</link> as a backend.</simpara>
<sidebar>
<simpara>Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets.
A secret is anything that to which you want to tightly control access, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and other sensitive information. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.</simpara>
</sidebar>
<simpara>For more information on Vault, see the <link xl:href="https://www.vaultproject.io/intro/index.html">Vault quick start guide</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>To enable the config server to use a Vault backend, you can run your config server with the <literal>vault</literal> profile.
For example, in your config server&#8217;s <literal>application.properties</literal>, you can add <literal>spring.profiles.active=vault</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>By default, the config server assumes that your Vault server runs at <literal><link xl:href="http://127.0.0.1:8200">http://127.0.0.1:8200</link></literal>.
It also assumes that the name of backend is <literal>secret</literal> and the key is <literal>application</literal>.
All of these defaults can be configured in your config server&#8217;s <literal>application.properties</literal>.
The following table describes configurable Vault properties:</simpara>

<important>
<simpara>All of the properties in the preceding table must be prefixed with <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.vault</literal>.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>All configurable properties can be found in <literal>org.springframework.cloud.config.server.environment.VaultEnvironmentRepository</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>With your config server running, you can make HTTP requests to the server to retrieve
values from the Vault backend.
To do so, you need a token for your Vault server.</simpara>
<simpara>First, place some data in you Vault, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="sh" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ vault write secret/application foo=bar baz=bam
$ vault write secret/myapp foo=myappsbar</programlisting>
<simpara>Second, make an HTTP request to your config server to retrieve the values, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<simpara><literal>$ curl -X "GET" "http://localhost:8888/myapp/default" -H "X-Config-Token: yourtoken"</literal></simpara>
<simpara>You should see a response similar to the following:</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
   "name":"myapp",
   "profiles":[
      "default"
   ],
   "label":null,
   "version":null,

      }
   ]
}</programlisting>
<section xml:id="_multiple_properties_sources">
<title>Multiple Properties Sources</title>
<simpara>When using Vault, you can provide your applications with multiple properties sources.
For example, assume you have written data to the following paths in Vault:</simpara>
<programlisting language="sh" linenumbering="unnumbered">secret/myApp,dev
secret/myApp
secret/application,dev
secret/application</programlisting>
<simpara>Properties written to <literal>secret/application</literal> are available to <link linkend="_vault_server">all applications using the Config Server</link>.
An application with the name, <literal>myApp</literal>, would have any properties written to <literal>secret/myApp</literal> and <literal>secret/application</literal> available to it.
When <literal>myApp</literal> has the <literal>dev</literal> profile enabled, properties written to all of the above paths would be available to it, with properties in the first path in the list taking priority over the others.</simpara>

<simpara>With file-based (git, svn, and native) repositories, resources with file names in <literal>application*</literal> (<literal>application.properties</literal>, <literal>application.yml</literal>, <literal>application-*.properties</literal>, and so on) are shared between all client applications.
You can use resources with these file names to configure global defaults and have them be overridden by application-specific files as necessary.</simpara>
<simpara>The #_property_overrides[property overrides] feature can also be used for setting global defaults, with placeholders applications

<section xml:id="_jdbc_backend">
<title>JDBC Backend</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Config Server supports JDBC (relational database) as a backend for configuration properties.
You can enable this feature by adding <literal>spring-jdbc</literal> to the classpath and using the <literal>jdbc</literal> profile or by adding a bean of type <literal>JdbcEnvironmentRepository</literal>.
If you include the right dependencies on the classpath (see the user guide for more details on that), Spring Boot configures a data source.</simpara>
<simpara>The database needs to have a table called <literal>PROPERTIES</literal> with columns called <literal>APPLICATION</literal>, <literal>PROFILE</literal>, and <literal>LABEL</literal> (with the usual <literal>Environment</literal> meaning), plus <literal>KEY</literal> and <literal>VALUE</literal> for the key and value pairs in <literal>Properties</literal> style.
All fields are of type String in Java, so you can make them <literal>VARCHAR</literal> of whatever length you need.
Property values behave in the same way as they would if they came from Spring Boot properties files named <literal>{application}-{profile}.properties</literal>, including all the encryption and decryption, which will be applied as post-processing steps (that is, not in the repository implementation directly).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_composite_environment_repositories">
<title>Composite Environment Repositories</title>
<simpara>In some scenarios, you may wish to pull configuration data from multiple environment repositories.
To do so, you can enable multiple profiles in your config server&#8217;s application properties or YAML file.
If, for example, you want to pull configuration data from a Git repository as well as an SVN repository, you can set the following properties for your configuration server:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  profiles:
    active: git, svn
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        svn:
          uri: file:///path/to/svn/repo
          order: 2
        git:
          uri: file:///path/to/git/repo
          order: 1</programlisting>
<simpara>In addition to each repository specifying a URI, you can also specify an <literal>order</literal> property.
The <literal>order</literal> property lets you specify the priority order for all your repositories.
The lower the numerical value of the <literal>order</literal> property, the higher priority it has.
The priority order of a repository helps resolve any potential conflicts between repositories that contain values for the same properties.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Any type of failure when retrieving values from an environment repository results in a failure for the entire composite environment.</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>When using a composite environment, it is important that all repositories contain the same labels.
If you have an environment similar to the one in the preceding example and you request configuration data with the <literal>master</literal> label but the SVN repository does not contain a branch called <literal>master</literal>, the entire request fails.</simpara>
</note>
<section xml:id="_custom_composite_environment_repositories">
<title>Custom Composite Environment Repositories</title>
<simpara>In addition to using one of the environment repositories from Spring Cloud, you can also provide your own <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> bean to be included as part of a composite environment.
To do so, your bean must implement the <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> interface.
If you want to control the priority of your custom <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> within the composite environment, you should also implement the <literal>Ordered</literal> interface and override the <literal>getOrdered</literal> method.
If you do not implement the <literal>Ordered</literal> interface, your <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> is given the lowest priority.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="_property_overrides">
<title>Property Overrides</title>
<simpara>The Config Server has an &#8220;overrides&#8221; feature that lets the operator provide configuration properties to all applications.
The overridden properties cannot be accidentally changed by the application with the normal Spring Boot hooks.
To declare overrides, add a map of name-value pairs to <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.overrides</literal>, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        overrides:
          foo: bar</programlisting>
<simpara>The preceding examples causes all applications that are config clients to read <literal>foo=bar</literal>, independent of their own configuration.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>A configuration system cannot force an application to use configuration data in any particular way.
Consequently, overrides are not enforceable.
However, they do provide useful default behavior for Spring Cloud Config clients.</simpara>
</note>
<tip>
<simpara>Normally, Spring environment placeholders with <literal>${}</literal> can be escaped (and resolved on the client) by using backslash (<literal>\</literal>) to escape the <literal>$</literal> or the <literal>{</literal>.
For example, <literal>\${app.foo:bar}</literal> resolves to <literal>bar</literal>, unless the app provides its own <literal>app.foo</literal>.</simpara>
</tip>
<note>
<simpara>In YAML, you do not need to escape the backslash itself.
However, in properties files, you do need to escape the backslash, when you configure the overrides on the server.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>You can change the priority of all overrides in the client to be more like default values, letting applications supply their own values in environment variables or System properties, by setting the  <literal>spring.cloud.config.overrideNone=true</literal> flag (the default is false) in the remote repository.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="_health_indicator_2">
<title>Health Indicator</title>
<simpara>Config Server comes with a Health Indicator that checks whether the configured <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> is working.
By default, it asks the <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> for an application named <literal>app</literal>, the <literal>default</literal> profile, and the default label provided by the <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> implementation.</simpara>
<simpara>You can configure the Health Indicator to check more applications along with custom profiles and custom labels, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        health:
          repositories:
            myservice:
              label: mylabel
            myservice-dev:
              name: myservice
              profiles: development</programlisting>
<simpara>You can disable the Health Indicator by setting <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.health.enabled=false</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_security">
<title>Security</title>
<simpara>You can secure your Config Server in any way that makes sense to you (from physical network security to OAuth2 bearer tokens), because Spring Security and Spring Boot offer support for many security arrangements.</simpara>
<simpara>To use the default Spring Boot-configured HTTP Basic security, include Spring Security on the classpath (for example, through <literal>spring-boot-starter-security</literal>).
The default is a username of <literal>user</literal> and a randomly generated password. A random password is not useful in practice, so we recommend you configure the password (by setting <literal>spring.security.user.password</literal>) and encrypt it (see below for instructions on how to do that).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_encryption_and_decryption_2">
<title>Encryption and Decryption</title>
<important>
<simpara>To use the encryption and decryption features you need the full-strength JCE installed in your JVM (it is not included by default).
You can download the &#8220;Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files&#8221; from Oracle and follow the installation instructions (essentially, you need to replace the two policy files in the JRE lib/security directory with the ones that you downloaded).</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>If the remote property sources contain encrypted content (values starting with <literal>{cipher}</literal>), they are decrypted before sending to clients over HTTP.
The main advantage of this setup is that the property values need not be in plain text when they are &#8220;at rest&#8221; (for example, in a git repository).
If a value cannot be decrypted, it is removed from the property source and an additional property is added with the same key but prefixed with <literal>invalid</literal> and a value that means &#8220;not applicable&#8221; (usually <literal>&lt;n/a&gt;</literal>).
This is largely to prevent cipher text being used as a password and accidentally leaking.</simpara>
<simpara>If you set up a remote config repository for config client applications, it might contain an <literal>application.yml</literal> similar to the following:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  datasource:
    username: dbuser
    password: '{cipher}FKSAJDFGYOS8F7GLHAKERGFHLSAJ'</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Encrypted values in a .properties file must not be wrapped in quotes. Otherwise, the value is not decrypted. The following example shows values that would work:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.properties</title>
<para>
<screen>spring.datasource.username: dbuser
spring.datasource.password: {cipher}FKSAJDFGYOS8F7GLHAKERGFHLSAJ</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>You can safely push this plain text to a shared git repository, and the secret password remains protected.</simpara>
<simpara>The server also exposes <literal>/encrypt</literal> and <literal>/decrypt</literal> endpoints (on the assumption that these are secured and only accessed by authorized agents).
If you edit a remote config file, you can use the Config Server to encrypt values by POSTing to the <literal>/encrypt</literal> endpoint, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>$ curl localhost:8888/encrypt -d mysecret
682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda</screen>
<note>
<simpara>If the value you encrypt has characters in it that need to be URL encoded, you should use the <literal>--data-urlencode</literal> option to <literal>curl</literal> to make sure they are encoded properly.</simpara>
</note>
<tip>
<simpara>Be sure not to include any of the curl command statistics in the encrypted value.
Outputting the value to a file can help avoid this problem.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>The inverse operation is also available through <literal>/decrypt</literal> (provided the server is
configured with a symmetric key or a full key pair), as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>$ curl localhost:8888/decrypt -d 682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda
mysecret</screen>
<tip>
<simpara>If you testing with curl, then use <literal>--data-urlencode</literal> (instead of <literal>-d</literal>) or set an explicit <literal>Content-Type: text/plain</literal> to make sure curl encodes the data correctly when there are special characters ('+' is particularly tricky).</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>Take the encrypted value and add the <literal>{cipher}</literal> prefix before you put it in the YAML or properties file and before you commit and push it to a remote (potentially insecure) store.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>/encrypt</literal> and <literal>/decrypt</literal> endpoints also both accept paths in the form of <literal>/*/{name}/{profiles}</literal>, which can be used to control cryptography on a per-application (name) and per-profile basis when clients call into the main environment resource.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>To control the cryptography in this granular way, you must also provide a <literal>@Bean</literal> of type <literal>TextEncryptorLocator</literal> that creates a different encryptor per name and profiles.
The one that is provided by default does not do so (all encryptions use the same key).</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>The <literal>spring</literal> command line client (with Spring Cloud CLI extensions
installed) can also be used to encrypt and decrypt, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>$ spring encrypt mysecret --key foo
682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda
$ spring decrypt --key foo 682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda
mysecret</screen>
<simpara>To use a key in a file (such as an RSA public key for encryption), prepend
the key value with "@" and provide the file path, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>$ spring encrypt mysecret --key @${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
AQAjPgt3eFZQXwt8tsHAVv/QHiY5sI2dRcR+...</screen>
<note>
<simpara>The <literal>--key</literal> argument is mandatory (despite having a <literal>--</literal> prefix).</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_key_management">
<title>Key Management</title>
<simpara>The Config Server can use a symmetric (shared) key or an asymmetric one (RSA key pair).
The asymmetric choice is superior in terms of security, but it is often more convenient to use a symmetric key since it is a single property value to configure in the <literal>bootstrap.properties</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To configure a symmetric key, you need to set <literal>encrypt.key</literal> to a secret String (or use the <literal>ENCRYPT_KEY</literal> environment variable to keep it out of plain-text configuration files).</simpara>
<simpara>To configure an asymmetric key, you can either set the key as a PEM-encoded text value (in <literal>encrypt.key</literal>) or use a keystore (such as the keystore created by the <literal>keytool</literal> utility that comes with the JDK).
The following table describes the keystore properties:</simpara>
<informaltable frame="all" rowsep="1" colsep="1">
<tgroup cols="2">
<colspec colname="col_1" colwidth="50*"/>
<colspec colname="col_2" colwidth="50*"/>

</row>
</tbody>
</tgroup>
</informaltable>
<simpara>The encryption is done with the public key, and a private key is
needed for decryption.
Thus, in principle, you can configure only the public key in the server if you want to only encrypt (and are prepared to decrypt the values yourself locally with the private key).
In practice, you might not want to do decrypt locally, because it spreads the key management process around all the clients, instead of
concentrating it in the server.
On the other hand, it can be a useful option if your config server is relatively insecure and only a handful of clients need the encrypted properties.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_creating_a_key_store_for_testing">
<title>Creating a Key Store for Testing</title>
<simpara>To create a keystore for testing, you can use a command resembling the following:</simpara>
<screen>$ keytool -genkeypair -alias mytestkey -keyalg RSA \
  -dname "CN=Web Server,OU=Unit,O=Organization,L=City,S=State,C=US" \
  -keypass changeme -keystore server.jks -storepass letmein</screen>
<simpara>Put the <literal>server.jks</literal> file in the classpath (for instance) and then, in

<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">encrypt:
  keyStore:
    location: classpath:/server.jks
    password: letmein
    alias: mytestkey
    secret: changeme</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_using_multiple_keys_and_key_rotation">
<title>Using Multiple Keys and Key Rotation</title>
<simpara>In addition to the <literal>{cipher}</literal> prefix in encrypted property values, the Config Server looks for zero or more <literal>{name:value}</literal> prefixes before the start of the (Base64 encoded) cipher text.
The keys are passed to a <literal>TextEncryptorLocator</literal>, which can do whatever logic it needs to locate a <literal>TextEncryptor</literal> for the cipher.
If you have configured a keystore (<literal>encrypt.keystore.location</literal>), the default locator looks for keys with aliases supplied by the <literal>key</literal> prefix, with a cipher text like resembling the following:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">foo:
  bar: `{cipher}{key:testkey}...`</programlisting>
<simpara>The locator looks for a key named "testkey".
A secret can also be supplied by using a <literal>{secret:&#8230;&#8203;}</literal> value in the prefix.
However, if it is not supplied, the default is to use the keystore password (which is what you get when you build a keytore and do not specify a secret).
If you do supply a secret, you should also encrypt the secret using a custom <literal>SecretLocator</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>When the keys are being used only to encrypt a few bytes of configuration data (that is, they are not being used elsewhere), key rotation is hardly ever necessary on cryptographic grounds.
However, you might occasionally  need to change the keys (for example, in the event of a security breach).
In that case, all the clients would need to change their source config files (for example, in git) and use a new <literal>{key:&#8230;&#8203;}</literal> prefix in all the ciphers.
Note that the clients need to first check that the key alias is available in the Config Server keystore.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>If you want to let the Config Server handle all encryption as well as decryption, the <literal>{name:value}</literal> prefixes can also be added as plain text posted to the <literal>/encrypt</literal> endpoint, .</simpara>
</tip>

<section xml:id="_serving_encrypted_properties">
<title>Serving Encrypted Properties</title>
<simpara>Sometimes you want the clients to decrypt the configuration locally, instead of doing it in the server.
In that case, if you provide the <literal>encrypt.*</literal> configuration to locate a key, you can still have <literal>/encrypt</literal> and <literal>/decrypt</literal> endpoints, but you need to explicitly switch off the decryption of outgoing properties by setting <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.encrypt.enabled=false</literal>.

<title>Serving Alternative Formats</title>
<simpara>The default JSON format from the environment endpoints is perfect for consumption by Spring applications, because it maps directly onto the <literal>Environment</literal> abstraction.
If you prefer, you can consume the same data as YAML or Java properties by adding a suffix (".yml", ".yaml" or ".properties") to the resource path.
This can be useful for consumption by applications that do not care about the structure of the JSON endpoints or the extra metadata they provide (for example, an application that is not using Spring might benefit from the simplicity of this approach).</simpara>
<simpara>The YAML and properties representations have an additional flag (provided as a boolean query parameter called <literal>resolvePlaceholders</literal>) to signal that placeholders in the source documents (in the standard Spring <literal>${&#8230;&#8203;}</literal> form) should be resolved in the output before rendering, where possible.
This is a useful feature for consumers that do not know about the Spring placeholder conventions.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>There are limitations in using the YAML or properties formats, mainly in relation to the loss of metadata.
For example, the JSON is structured as an ordered list of property sources, with names that correlate with the source.
The YAML and properties forms are coalesced into a single map, even if the origin of the values has multiple sources, and the names of the original source files are lost.
Also, the YAML representation is not necessarily a faithful representation of the YAML source in a backing repository either. It is constructed from a list of flat property sources, and assumptions have to be made about the form of the keys.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_serving_plain_text">
<title>Serving Plain Text</title>
<simpara>Instead of using the <literal>Environment</literal> abstraction (or one of the alternative representations of it in YAML or properties format), your applications might need generic plain-text configuration files that are tailored to their environment.
The Config Server provides these through an additional endpoint at <literal>/{name}/{profile}/{label}/{path}</literal>, where <literal>name</literal>, <literal>profile</literal>, and <literal>label</literal> have the same meaning as the regular environment endpoint, but <literal>path</literal> is a file name (such as <literal>log.xml</literal>).
The source files for this endpoint are located in the same way as for the environment endpoints.
The same search path is used for properties and YAML files.
However, instead of aggregating all matching resources, only the first one to match is returned.</simpara>
<simpara>After a resource is located, placeholders in the normal format (<literal>${&#8230;&#8203;}</literal>) are resolved by using the effective <literal>Environment</literal> for the supplied application name, profile, and label.
In this way, the resource endpoint is tightly integrated with the environment endpoints.
Consider the following example for a GIT or SVN repository:</simpara>
<screen>application.yml
nginx.conf</screen>
<simpara>where <literal>nginx.conf</literal> looks like this:</simpara>
<screen>server {
    listen              80;
    server_name         ${nginx.server.name};
}</screen>
<simpara>and <literal>application.yml</literal> like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">nginx:
  server:
    name: example.com
---
spring:
  profiles: development
nginx:
  server:
    name: develop.com</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>/foo/default/master/nginx.conf</literal> resource might be as follows:</simpara>
<screen>server {
    listen              80;
    server_name         example.com;
}</screen>
<simpara>and <literal>/foo/development/master/nginx.conf</literal> like this:</simpara>
<screen>server {
    listen              80;
    server_name         develop.com;
}</screen>
<note>
<simpara>As with the source files for environment configuration, the <literal>profile</literal> is used to resolve the file name.
So, if you want a profile-specific file, <literal>/*/development/*/logback.xml</literal> can be resolved by a file called <literal>logback-development.xml</literal> (in preference to <literal>logback.xml</literal>).</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>If you do not want to supply the <literal>label</literal> and let the server use the default label, you can supply a <literal>useDefaultLabel</literal> request parameter.
So, the preceding example for the <literal>default</literal> profile could be <literal>/foo/default/nginx.conf?useDefaultLabel</literal>.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_embedding_the_config_server">
<title>Embedding the Config Server</title>
<simpara>The Config Server runs best as a standalone application.
However, if need be, you can embed it in another application.
To do so, use the <literal>@EnableConfigServer</literal> annotation.
An optional property named <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.bootstrap</literal> can be useful in this case is.
It is a flag to indicate whether the server should configure itself from its own remote repository.
By default, the flag is off, because it can delay startup.
However, when embedded in another application, it makes sense to initialize the same way as any other application.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>If you use the bootstrap flag, the config server needs to have its name and repository URI configured in <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>To change the location of the server endpoints, you can (optionally) set <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.prefix</literal> (for example, <literal>/config</literal>), to serve the resources under a prefix.
The prefix should start but not end with a <literal>/</literal>.
It is applied to the <literal>@RequestMappings</literal> in the Config Server (that is, underneath the Spring Boot <literal>server.servletPath</literal> and <literal>server.contextPath</literal> prefixes).</simpara>
<simpara>If you want to read the configuration for an application directly from the backend repository (instead of from the config server), you
basically wat an embedded config server with no endpoints.
You can switch off the endpoints entirely by not using the <literal>@EnableConfigServer</literal> annotation (set <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.bootstrap=true</literal>).</simpara>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_push_notifications_and_spring_cloud_bus">
<title>Push Notifications and Spring Cloud Bus</title>
<simpara>Many source code repository providers (such as Github, Gitlab, Gitee, or Bitbucket) notify you of changes in a repository through a webhook.
You can configure the webhook through the provider&#8217;s user interface as a URL and a set of events in which you are interested.
For instance, <link xl:href="https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pushevent">Github</link> uses a POST to the webhook with a JSON body containing a list of commits and a header (<literal>X-Github-Event</literal>) set to <literal>push</literal>.
If you add a dependency on the <literal>spring-cloud-config-monitor</literal> library and activate the Spring Cloud Bus in your Config Server, then a <literal>/monitor</literal> endpoint is enabled.</simpara>
<simpara>When the webhook is activated, the Config Server sends a <literal>RefreshRemoteApplicationEvent</literal> targeted at the applications it thinks might have changed.
The change detection can be strategized.
However, by default, it looks for changes in files that match the application name (for example, <literal>foo.properties</literal> is targeted at the <literal>foo</literal> application, while <literal>application.properties</literal> is targeted at all applications).
The strategy to use when you want to override the behavior is <literal>PropertyPathNotificationExtractor</literal>, which accepts the request headers and body as parameters and returns a list of file paths that changed.</simpara>
<simpara>The default configuration works out of the box with Github, Gitlab, Gitee, or Bitbucket.
In addition to the JSON notifications from Github, Gitlab, Gitee, or Bitbucket, you can trigger a change notification by POSTing to <literal>/monitor</literal> with form-encoded body parameters in the pattern of <literal>path={name}</literal>.
Doing so broadcasts to applications matching the <literal>{name}</literal> pattern (which can contain wildcards).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The <literal>RefreshRemoteApplicationEvent</literal> is transmitted only if the <literal>spring-cloud-bus</literal> is activated in both the Config Server and in the client application.</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>The default configuration also detects filesystem changes in local git repositories. In that case, the webhook is not used. However, as soon as you edit a config file, a refresh is broadcast.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_spring_cloud_config_client">
<title>Spring Cloud Config Client</title>
<simpara>A Spring Boot application can take immediate advantage of the Spring Config Server (or other external property sources provided by the application developer).
It also picks up some additional useful features related to <literal>Environment</literal> change events.</simpara>
<section xml:id="config-first-bootstrap">
<title>Config First Bootstrap</title>
<simpara>The default behavior for any application that has the Spring Cloud Config Client on the classpath is as follows:
When a config client starts, it binds to the Config Server (through the <literal>spring.cloud.config.uri</literal> bootstrap configuration property) and initializes Spring <literal>Environment</literal> with remote property sources.</simpara>
<simpara>The net result of this behavior is that all client applciations that want to consume the Config Server need a <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal> (or an environment variable) with the server address set in <literal>spring.cloud.config.uri</literal> (it defaults to "http://localhost:8888").</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="discovery-first-bootstrap">
<title>Discovery First Bootstrap</title>
<simpara>If you use a `DiscoveryClient implementation, such as Spring Cloud Netflix and Eureka Service Discovery or Spring Cloud Consul, you can have the Config Server register with the Discovery Service.
However, in the default &#8220;Config First&#8221; mode, clients cannot take advantage of the registration.</simpara>
<simpara>If you prefer to use <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> to locate the Config Server, you can do so by setting <literal>spring.cloud.config.discovery.enabled=true</literal> (the default is <literal>false</literal>).
The net result of doing so is that client applications all need a <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal> (or an environment variable) with the appropriate discovery configuration.
For example, with Spring Cloud Netflix, you need to define the Eureka server address (for example, in <literal>eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone</literal>).
The price for using this option is an extra network round trip on startup, to locate the service registration.
The benefit is that, as long as the Discovery Service is a fixed point, the Config Server can change its coordinates.
The default service ID is <literal>configserver</literal>, but you can change that on the client by setting <literal>spring.cloud.config.discovery.serviceId</literal> (and on the server, in the usual way for a service, such as by setting <literal>spring.application.name</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>The discovery client implementations all support some kind of metadata map (for example, we have <literal>eureka.instance.metadataMap</literal> for Eureka).
Some additional properties of the Config Server may need to be configured in its service registration metadata so that clients can connect correctly.
If the Config Server is secured with HTTP Basic, you can configure the credentials as <literal>username</literal> and <literal>password</literal>.
Also, if the Config Server has a context path, you can set <literal>configPath</literal>.
For example, the following YAML file is for a Config Server that is a Eureka client:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>bootstrap.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">eureka:

<section xml:id="config-client-fail-fast">
<title>Config Client Fail Fast</title>
<simpara>In some cases, you may want to fail startup of a service if it cannot connect to the Config Server.
If this is the desired behavior, set the bootstrap configuration property <literal>spring.cloud.config.fail-fast=true</literal> to make the client halt with an Exception.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="config-client-retry">
<title>Config Client Retry</title>
<simpara>If you expect that the config server may occasionally be unavailable when your application starts, you can make it keep trying after a failure.
First, you need to set <literal>spring.cloud.config.fail-fast=true</literal>.
Then you need to add <literal>spring-retry</literal> and <literal>spring-boot-starter-aop</literal> to your classpath.
The default behavior is to retry six times with an initial backoff interval of 1000ms and an exponential multiplier of 1.1 for subsequent backoffs.
You can configure these properties (and others) by setting the <literal>spring.cloud.config.retry.*</literal> configuration properties.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>To take full control of the retry behavior, add a <literal>@Bean</literal> of type <literal>RetryOperationsInterceptor</literal> with an ID of <literal>configServerRetryInterceptor</literal>.
Spring Retry has a <literal>RetryInterceptorBuilder</literal> that supports creating one.</simpara>
</tip>

<section xml:id="_locating_remote_configuration_resources">
<title>Locating Remote Configuration Resources</title>

<simpara>"name" = <literal>${spring.application.name}</literal></simpara>

<simpara>You can override all of them by setting <literal>spring.cloud.config.*</literal> (where <literal>*</literal> is <literal>name</literal>, <literal>profile</literal> or <literal>label</literal>).
The <literal>label</literal> is useful for rolling back to previous versions of configuration.
With the default Config Server implementation, it can be a git label, branch name, or commit ID.
Label can also be provided as a comma-separated list.
In that case, the items in the list are tried one by one until one succeeds.
This behavior can be useful when working on a feature branch.
For instance, you might want to align the config label with your branch but make it optional (in that case, use <literal>spring.cloud.config.label=myfeature,develop</literal>).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_security_2">
<title>Security</title>

<simpara>The <literal>spring.cloud.config.password</literal> and <literal>spring.cloud.config.username</literal> values override anything that is provided in the URI.</simpara>
<simpara>If you deploy your apps on Cloud Foundry, the best way to provide the password is through service credentials (such as in the URI, since it does not need to be in a config file).

<title>Registering with Eureka</title>
<simpara>When a client registers with Eureka, it provides meta-data about itself&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;such as host, port, health indicator URL, home page, and other details.
Eureka receives heartbeat messages from each instance belonging to a service.
If the heartbeat fails over a configurable timetable, the instance is normally removed from the registry.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows a minimal Eureka client application:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class Application {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home() {
        return "Hello world";

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new SpringApplicationBuilder(Application.class).web(true).run(args);
    }

}</programlisting>
<simpara>Note that the preceding example shows a normal <link xl:href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</link> application.
By having <literal>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</literal> on the classpath, your application automatically registers with the Eureka Server.  Configuration is required to locate the Eureka server, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>eureka:
  client:
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/</screen>

</formalpara>
<simpara>In the preceding example, "defaultZone" is a magic string fallback value that provides the service URL for any client that does not express a preference (in other words, it is a useful default).</simpara>
<simpara>The default application name (that is, the service ID), virtual host, and non-secure port (taken from the <literal>Environment</literal>) are <literal>${spring.application.name}</literal>, <literal>${spring.application.name}</literal> and <literal>${server.port}</literal>, respectively.</simpara>
<simpara>Having <literal>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</literal> on the classpath makes the app into both a Eureka &#8220;instance&#8221; (that is, it registers itself) and a &#8220;client&#8221; (it can query the registry to locate other services).
The instance behaviour is driven by <literal>eureka.instance.*</literal> configuration keys, but the defaults are fine if you ensure that your application has a value for <literal>spring.application.name</literal> (this is the default for the Eureka service ID or VIP).</simpara>
<simpara>See <link xl:href="http://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/tree/master/spring-cloud-netflix-eureka-client/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/netflix/eureka/EurekaInstanceConfigBean.java">EurekaInstanceConfigBean</link> and <link xl:href="http://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/tree/master/spring-cloud-netflix-eureka-client/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/netflix/eureka/EurekaClientConfigBean.java">EurekaClientConfigBean</link> for more details on the configurable options.</simpara>

<title>Status Page and Health Indicator</title>
<simpara>The status page and health indicators for a Eureka instance default to <literal>/info</literal> and <literal>/health</literal> respectively, which are the default locations of useful endpoints in a Spring Boot Actuator application.
You need to change these, even for an Actuator application if you use a non-default context path or servlet path (such as <literal>server.servletPath=/custom</literal>) or management endpoint path (such as <literal>management.contextPath=/admin</literal>). The following example shows the default values for the two settings:</simpara>

</section>
<section xml:id="_registering_a_secure_application">
<title>Registering a Secure Application</title>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>eureka.instance.[securePortEnabled]=[true]</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Doing so makes Eureka publish instance information that shows an explicit preference for secure communication.
The Spring Cloud <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> always returns a URI starting with <literal>https</literal> for a service configured this way.
Similarly, when a service is configured this way, the Eureka (native) instance information has a secure health check URL.</simpara>
<simpara>Because of the way Eureka works internally, it still publishes a non-secure URL for the status and home pages unless you also override those explicitly.
You can use placeholders to configure the eureka instance URLs, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>eureka:
  instance:
    statusPageUrl: https://${eureka.hostname}/info
    healthCheckUrl: https://${eureka.hostname}/health
    homePageUrl: https://${eureka.hostname}/</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>(Note that <literal>${eureka.hostname}</literal> is a native placeholder only available
in later versions of Eureka. You could achieve the same thing with
Spring placeholders as well&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for example, by using <literal>${eureka.instance.hostName}</literal>.)</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>If your application runs behind a proxy, and the SSL termination is in the proxy (for example, if you run in Cloud Foundry or other platforms as a service), then you need to ensure that the proxy &#8220;forwarded&#8221; headers are intercepted and handled by the application.
If the Tomcat container embedded in a Spring Boot application has explicit configuration for the 'X-Forwarded-\*` headers, this happens automatically.
The links rendered by your app to itself being wrong (the wrong host, port, or protocol) is a sign that you got this configuration wrong.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_eureka_s_health_checks">

<simpara>By default, Eureka uses the client heartbeat to determine if a client is up.
Unless specified otherwise, the Discovery Client does not propagate the current health check status of the application, per the Spring Boot Actuator.
Consequently, after successful registration, Eureka always announces that the application is in 'UP' state. This behavior can be altered by enabling Eureka health checks, which results in propagating application status to Eureka.
As a consequence, every other application does not send traffic to applications in states other then 'UP'.
The following example shows how to enable health checks for the client:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>eureka:
  client:
    healthcheck:
      enabled: true</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<warning>
<simpara><literal>eureka.client.healthcheck.enabled=true</literal> should only be set in <literal>application.yml</literal>. Setting the value in <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal> causes undesirable side effects, such as registering in Eureka with an <literal>UNKNOWN</literal> status.</simpara>
</warning>
<simpara>If you require more control over the health checks, consider implementing your own <literal>com.netflix.appinfo.HealthCheckHandler</literal>.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_eureka_metadata_for_instances_and_clients">
<title>Eureka Metadata for Instances and Clients</title>
<simpara>It is worth spending a bit of time understanding how the Eureka metadata works, so you can use it in a way that makes sense in your platform.
There is standard metadata for information such as hostname, IP address, port numbers, the status page, and health check.
These are published in the service registry and used by clients to contact the services in a straightforward way.
Additional metadata can be added to the instance registration in the <literal>eureka.instance.metadataMap</literal>, and this metadata is accessible in the remote clients.
In general, additional metadata does not change the behavior of the client, unless the client is made aware of the meaning of the metadata.
There are a couple of special cases, described later in this document, where Spring Cloud already assigns meaning to the metadata map.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_using_eureka_on_cloudfoundry">
<title>Using Eureka on Cloudfoundry</title>
<simpara>Cloudfoundry has a global router so that all instances of the same app have the same hostname (other PaaS solutions with a similar architecture have the same arrangement).
This is not necessarily a barrier to using Eureka.
However, if you use the router (recommended or even mandatory, depending on the way your platform was set up), you need to explicitly set the hostname and port numbers (secure or non-secure) so that they use the router.
You might also want to use instance metadata so that you can distinguish between the instances on the client (for example, in a custom load balancer).
By default, the <literal>eureka.instance.instanceId</literal> is <literal>vcap.application.instance_id</literal>, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>eureka:
  instance:
    hostname: ${vcap.application.uris[0]}
    nonSecurePort: 80</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Depending on the way the security rules are set up in your Cloudfoundry instance, you might be able to register and use the IP address of the host VM for direct service-to-service calls.
This feature is not yet available on Pivotal Web Services (<link xl:href="https://run.pivotal.io">PWS</link>).</simpara>

<section xml:id="_using_eureka_on_aws">
<title>Using Eureka on AWS</title>
<simpara>If the application is planned to be deployed to an AWS cloud, the Eureka instance must be configured to be AWS-aware. You can do so by customizing the <link xl:href="http://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/tree/master/spring-cloud-netflix-eureka-client/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/netflix/eureka/EurekaInstanceConfigBean.java">EurekaInstanceConfigBean</link> as follows:</simpara>

<section xml:id="_changing_the_eureka_instance_id">
<title>Changing the Eureka Instance ID</title>
<simpara>A vanilla Netflix Eureka instance is registered with an ID that is equal to its host name (that is, there is only one service per host).
Spring Cloud Eureka provides a sensible default, which is defined as follows:</simpara>
<simpara><literal>${spring.cloud.client.hostname}:${spring.application.name}:${spring.application.instance_id:${server.port}}}</literal></simpara>
<simpara>An example is <literal>myhost:myappname:8080</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>By using Spring Cloud, you can override this value by providing a unique identifier in <literal>eureka.instance.instanceId</literal>, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>eureka:
  instance:
    instanceId: ${spring.application.name}:${vcap.application.instance_id:${spring.application.instance_id:${random.value}}}</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>With the metadata shown in the preceding example and multiple service instances deployed on localhost, the random value is inserted there to make the instance unique.
In Cloudfoundry, the <literal>vcap.application.instance_id</literal> is populated automatically in a Spring Boot application, so the random value is not needed.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_using_the_eurekaclient">
<title>Using the EurekaClient</title>
<simpara>Once you have an application that is a discovery client, you can use it to discover service instances from the <link linkend="spring-cloud-eureka-server">Eureka Server</link>.
One way to do so is to use the native <literal>com.netflix.discovery.EurekaClient</literal> (as opposed to the Spring Cloud <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal>), as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>@Autowired

<section xml:id="_eurekaclient_without_jersey">

The following example shows Jersey being excluded:</simpara>

<title>Alternatives to the Native Netflix EurekaClient</title>
<simpara>You need not use the raw Netflix <literal>EurekaClient</literal>.
Also, it is usually more convenient to use it behind a wrapper of some sort.
Spring Cloud has support for <link linkend="spring-cloud-feign">Feign</link> (a REST client builder) and <link linkend="spring-cloud-ribbon">Spring <literal>RestTemplate</literal></link> through the logical Eureka service identifiers (VIPs) instead of physical URLs.
To configure Ribbon with a fixed list of physical servers, you can set <literal>&lt;client&gt;.ribbon.listOfServers</literal> to a comma-separated list of physical addresses (or hostnames), where <literal>&lt;client&gt;</literal> is the ID of the client.</simpara>
<simpara>You can also use the <literal>org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.DiscoveryClient</literal>, which provides a simple API (not specific to Netflix) for discovery clients, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>@Autowired
private DiscoveryClient discoveryClient;

public String serviceUrl() {
    List&lt;ServiceInstance&gt; list = discoveryClient.getInstances("STORES");
    if (list != null &amp;&amp; list.size() &gt; 0 ) {

</section>
<section xml:id="_why_is_it_so_slow_to_register_a_service">
<title>Why Is It so Slow to Register a Service?</title>
<simpara>Being an instance also involves a periodic heartbeat to the registry
(through the client&#8217;s <literal>serviceUrl</literal>) with a default duration of 30 seconds.
A service is not available for discovery by clients until the instance, the server, and the client all have the same metadata in their local
cache (so it could take 3 heartbeats).
You can change the period by setting <literal>eureka.instance.leaseRenewalIntervalInSeconds</literal>.
Setting it to a value of less than 30 speeds up the process of getting clients connected to other services.
In production, it is probably better to stick with the default, because of internal computations in the server that make assumptions about the lease renewal period.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_zones">
<title>Zones</title>
<simpara>If you have deployed Eureka clients to multiple zones, you may prefer that those clients use services within the same zone before trying services in another zone.
To set that up, you need to configure your Eureka clients correctly.</simpara>
<simpara>First, you need to make sure you have Eureka servers deployed to each zone and that
they are peers of each other.
See the section on <link linkend="spring-cloud-eureka-server-zones-and-regions">zones and regions</link>
for more information.</simpara>
<simpara>Next, you need to tell Eureka which zone your service is in.
You can do so by using the <literal>metadataMap</literal> property.
For example, if <literal>service 1</literal> is deployed to both <literal>zone 1</literal> and <literal>zone 2</literal>, you need to set the following Eureka properties in <literal>service 1</literal>:</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Service 1 in Zone 1</emphasis></simpara>
<screen>eureka.instance.metadataMap.zone = zone1
eureka.client.preferSameZoneEureka = true</screen>

<simpara>The Eureka server does not have a backend store, but the service instances in the registry all have to send heartbeats to keep their registrations up to date (so this can be done in memory).
Clients also have an in-memory cache of Eureka registrations (so they do not have to go to the registry for every request to a service).</simpara>
<simpara>By default, every Eureka server is also a Eureka client and requires (at least one) service URL to locate a peer.
If you do not provide it, the service runs and works, but it fills your logs with a lot of noise about not being able to register with the peer.</simpara>

</section>
<section xml:id="spring-cloud-eureka-server-standalone-mode">
<title>Standalone Mode</title>
<simpara>The combination of the two caches (client and server) and the heartbeats make a standalone Eureka server fairly resilient to failure, as long as there is some sort of monitor or elastic runtime (such as Cloud Foundry) keeping it alive.
In standalone mode, you might prefer to switch off the client side behavior so that it does not keep trying and failing to reach its peers.
The following example shows how to switch off the client-side behavior:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml (Standalone Eureka Server)</title>
<para>
<screen>server:
  port: 8761

eureka:
  instance:
    hostname: localhost
  client:
    registerWithEureka: false
    fetchRegistry: false
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://${eureka.instance.hostname}:${server.port}/eureka/</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Notice that the <literal>serviceUrl</literal> is pointing to the same host as the local instance.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="spring-cloud-eureka-server-peer-awareness">
<title>Peer Awareness</title>
<simpara>Eureka can be made even more resilient and available by running multiple instances and asking them to register with each other.
In fact, this is the default behavior, so all you need to do to make it work is add a valid <literal>serviceUrl</literal> to a peer, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml (Two Peer Aware Eureka Servers)</title>
<para>
<screen>---
spring:
  profiles: peer1
eureka:
  instance:
    hostname: peer1
  client:

      defaultZone: http://peer2/eureka/

---
spring:
  profiles: peer2
eureka:
  instance:
    hostname: peer2
  client:
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://peer1/eureka/</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>In the preceding example, we have a YAML file that can be used to run the same server on two hosts (<literal>peer1</literal> and <literal>peer2</literal>) by running it in different Spring profiles.
You could use this configuration to test the peer awareness on a single host (there is not much value in doing that in production) by manipulating <literal>/etc/hosts</literal> to resolve the host names.
In fact, the <literal>eureka.instance.hostname</literal> is not needed if you are running on a machine that knows its own hostname (by default, it is looked up by using <literal>java.net.InetAddress</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>You can add multiple peers to a system, and, as long as they are all connected to each other by at least one edge, they synchronize
the registrations amongst themselves.
If the peers are physically separated (inside a data center or between multiple data centers), then the system can, in principle, survive &#8220;split-brain&#8221; type failures.</simpara>

<section xml:id="spring-cloud-eureka-server-prefer-ip-address">

<tip>
<simpara>If the hostname cannot be determined by Java, then the IP address is sent to Eureka.
Only explict way of setting the hostname is by setting <literal>eureka.instance.hostname</literal> property.

<chapter xml:id="_circuit_breaker_hystrix_clients">
<title>Circuit Breaker: Hystrix Clients</title>
<simpara>Netflix has created a library called <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix">Hystrix</link> that implements the <link xl:href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html">circuit breaker pattern</link>.
In a microservice architecture, it is common to have multiple layers of service calls, as shown in the following example:</simpara>

</imageobject>
<textobject><phrase>Hystrix</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>A service failure in the lower level of services can cause cascading failure all the way up to the user.
When calls to a particular service exceed <literal>circuitBreaker.requestVolumeThreshold</literal> (default: 20 requests) and the failure percentage is greater than <literal>circuitBreaker.errorThresholdPercentage</literal> (default: &gt;50%) in a rolling window defined by <literal>metrics.rollingStats.timeInMilliseconds</literal> (default: 10 seconds), the circuit opens and the call is not made.
In cases of error and an open circuit, a fallback can be provided by the developer.</simpara>

<textobject><phrase>HystrixFallback</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>Having an open circuit stops cascading failures and allows overwhelmed or failing services time to recover.
The fallback can be another Hystrix protected call, static data, or a sensible empty value.
Fallbacks may be chained so that the first fallback makes some other business call, which in turn falls back to static data.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_how_to_include_hystrix">

    public Object getStores(Map&lt;String, Object&gt; parameters) {
        //do stuff that might fail
    }

    public Object defaultStores(Map&lt;String, Object&gt; parameters) {
        return /* something useful */;

<simpara>The <literal>@HystrixCommand</literal> is provided by a Netflix contrib library called <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/tree/master/hystrix-contrib/hystrix-javanica">&#8220;javanica&#8221;</link>.
Spring Cloud automatically wraps Spring beans with that annotation in a proxy that is connected to the Hystrix circuit breaker.
The circuit breaker calculates when to open and close the circuit and what to do in case of a failure.</simpara>
<simpara>To configure the <literal>@HystrixCommand</literal> you can use the <literal>commandProperties</literal>
attribute with a list of <literal>@HystrixProperty</literal> annotations.  See
<link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/tree/master/hystrix-contrib/hystrix-javanica#configuration">here</link>

for details on the properties available.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="netflix-hystrix-starter">
<title>Propagating the Security Context or Using Spring Scopes</title>
<simpara>If you want some thread local context to propagate into a <literal>@HystrixCommand</literal>, the default declaration does not work, because it executes the command in a thread pool (in case of timeouts).
You can switch Hystrix to use the same thread as the caller through configuration or directly in the annotation, by asking it to use a different &#8220;Isolation Strategy&#8221;.
The following example demonstrates setting the thread in the annotation:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "stubMyService",
    commandProperties = {
      @HystrixProperty(name="execution.isolation.strategy", value="SEMAPHORE")

<simpara>The same thing applies if you are using <literal>@SessionScope</literal> or <literal>@RequestScope</literal>.
If you encounter a runtime exception that says it cannot find the scoped context, you need to use the same thread.</simpara>
<simpara>You also have the option to set the <literal>hystrix.shareSecurityContext</literal> property to <literal>true</literal>.
Doing so auto-configures a Hystrix concurrency strategy plugin hook to transfer the <literal>SecurityContext</literal> from your main thread to the one used by the Hystrix command.
Hystrix does not let multiple Hystrix concurrency strategy be registered so an extension mechanism is available by declaring your own <literal>HystrixConcurrencyStrategy</literal> as a Spring bean.
Spring Cloud looks for your implementation within the Spring context and wrap it inside its own plugin.</simpara>

The only difference is that the <literal>turbine.instanceUrlSuffix</literal> does not need the port prepended, as this is handled automatically unless <literal>turbine.instanceInsertPort=false</literal>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>By default, Turbine looks for the <literal>/hystrix.stream</literal> endpoint on a registered instance by looking up its <literal>hostName</literal> and <literal>port</literal> entries in Eureka and then appending <literal>/hystrix.stream</literal> to it.
If the instance&#8217;s metadata contains <literal>management.port</literal>, it is used instead of the <literal>port</literal> value for the <literal>/hystrix.stream</literal> endpoint.
By default, the metadata entry called <literal>management.port</literal> is equal to the <literal>management.port</literal> configuration property.
It can be overridden though with following configuration:</simpara>
</note>
<screen>eureka:
  instance:
    metadata-map:
      management.port: ${management.port:8081}</screen>
<simpara>The <literal>turbine.appConfig</literal> configuration key is a list of Eureka serviceIds that turbine uses to lookup instances.
The turbine stream is then used in the Hystrix dashboard with a URL similar to the following:</simpara>
<simpara><literal><link xl:href="http://my.turbine.server:8080/turbine.stream?cluster=CLUSTERNAME">http://my.turbine.server:8080/turbine.stream?cluster=CLUSTERNAME</link></literal></simpara>
<simpara>The cluster parameter can be omitted if the name is <literal>default</literal>.
The <literal>cluster</literal> parameter must match an entry in <literal>turbine.aggregator.clusterConfig</literal>.
Values returned from Eureka are upper-case. Consequently, the following example works if there is an application called <literal>customers</literal> registered with Eureka:</simpara>
<screen>turbine:
  aggregator:
    clusterConfig: CUSTOMERS
  appConfig: customers</screen>
<simpara>If you need to customize which cluster names should be used by Turbine (because you do not want to store cluster names in
<literal>turbine.aggregator.clusterConfig</literal> configuration), provide a bean of type <literal>TurbineClustersProvider</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>clusterName</literal> can be customized by a SPEL expression in <literal>turbine.clusterNameExpression</literal> with root as an instance of <literal>InstanceInfo</literal>.
The default value is <literal>appName</literal>, which means that the Eureka <literal>serviceId</literal> becomes the cluster key (that is, the <literal>InstanceInfo</literal> for customers has an <literal>appName</literal> of <literal>CUSTOMERS</literal>).
A different example is <literal>turbine.clusterNameExpression=aSGName</literal>, which gets the cluster name from the AWS ASG name.
The following listing shows another example:</simpara>
<screen>turbine:
  aggregator:
    clusterConfig: SYSTEM,USER
  appConfig: customers,stores,ui,admin
  clusterNameExpression: metadata['cluster']</screen>
<simpara>In the preceding example, the cluster name from four services is pulled from their metadata map and is expected to have values that include <literal>SYSTEM</literal> and <literal>USER</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To use the &#8220;default&#8221; cluster for all apps, you need a string literal expression (with single quotes and escaped with double quotes if it is in YAML as well):</simpara>
<screen>turbine:
  appConfig: customers,stores
  clusterNameExpression: "'default'"</screen>
<simpara>Spring Cloud provides a <literal>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-turbine</literal> that has all the dependencies you need to get a Turbine server running. To ad Turnbine, create a Spring Boot application and annotate it with <literal>@EnableTurbine</literal>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>By default, Spring Cloud lets Turbine use the host and port to allow multiple processes per host, per cluster.
If you want the native Netflix behavior built into Turbine to <emphasis>not</emphasis> allow multiple processes per host, per cluster (the key to the instance ID is the hostname), set <literal>turbine.combineHostPort=false</literal>.</simpara>
</note>

<section xml:id="_turbine_stream">
<title>Turbine Stream</title>
<simpara>In some environments (such as in a PaaS setting), the classic Turbine model of pulling metrics from all the distributed Hystrix commands does not work.
In that case, you might want to have your Hystrix commands push metrics to Turbine. Spring Cloud enables that with messaging.
To do so on the client, add a dependency to <literal>spring-cloud-netflix-hystrix-stream</literal> and the <literal>spring-cloud-starter-stream-*</literal> of your choice.
See the <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/Ditmars.SR2/reference/htmlsingle/">Spring Cloud Stream documentation</link> for details on the brokers and how to configure the client credentials. It should work out of the box for a local broker.</simpara>
<simpara>On the server side, create a Spring Boot application and annotate it with <literal>@EnableTurbineStream</literal>. By default, it starts on port 8989 (point your Hystrix dashboard to that port on any path).
You can customize the port by setting either <literal>server.port</literal> or <literal>turbine.stream.port</literal>.
If you have <literal>spring-boot-starter-web</literal> and <literal>spring-boot-starter-actuator</literal> on the classpath as well, you can expose the Actuator endpoints on a separate port (with Tomcat by default) by providing a <literal>management.port</literal> that differs from the Hystrix port.</simpara>
<simpara>You can then point the Hystrix Dashboard to the Turbine Stream Server instead of individual Hystrix streams.
If Turbine Stream is running on port 8989 on myhost, then put <literal><link xl:href="http://myhost:8989">http://myhost:8989</link></literal> in the stream input field in the Hystrix Dashboard.
Circuits are prefixed by their respective <literal>serviceId</literal>, followed by a dot (<literal>.</literal>), and then the circuit name.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud provides a <literal>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-turbine-stream</literal> that has all the dependencies you need to get a Turbine Stream server running.
You can then add the Stream binder of your choice&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;such as <literal>spring-cloud-starter-stream-rabbit</literal>.
Because it is Netty-based, you need Java 8 to run the application.</simpara>

<title>Client Side Load Balancer: Ribbon</title>
<simpara>Ribbon is a client-side load balancer that gives you a lot of control over the behavior of HTTP and TCP clients.
Feign already uses Ribbon, so, if you use <literal>@FeignClient</literal>, this section also applies.</simpara>
<simpara>A central concept in Ribbon is that of the named client.
Each load balancer is part of an ensemble of components that work together to contact a remote server on demand, and the ensemble has a name that you give it as an application developer (for example, by using the <literal>@FeignClient</literal> annotation).
On demand, Spring Cloud creates a new ensemble as an <literal>ApplicationContext</literal> for each named client by using
<literal>RibbonClientConfiguration</literal>.
This contains (amongst other things) an <literal>ILoadBalancer</literal>, a <literal>RestClient</literal>, and a <literal>ServerListFilter</literal>.</simpara>
<section xml:id="netflix-ribbon-starter">
<title>How to Include Ribbon</title>
<simpara>To include Ribbon in your project, use the starter with a group ID of <literal>org.springframework.cloud</literal> and an artifact ID of <literal>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon</literal>.

<section xml:id="_customizing_the_ribbon_client">
<title>Customizing the Ribbon Client</title>
<simpara>You can configure some bits of a Ribbon client by using external properties in <literal>&lt;client&gt;.ribbon.*</literal>, which is similar to using the Netflix APIs natively, except that you can use Spring Boot configuration files.
The native options can be inspected as static fields in <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon/blob/master/ribbon-core/src/main/java/com/netflix/client/config/CommonClientConfigKey.java"><literal>CommonClientConfigKey</literal></link> (part of ribbon-core).</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud also lets you take full control of the client by declaring additional configuration (on top of the <literal>RibbonClientConfiguration</literal>) using <literal>@RibbonClient</literal>, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Configuration
@RibbonClient(name = "custom", configuration = CustomConfiguration.class)
public class TestConfiguration {
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In this case, the client is composed from the components already in <literal>RibbonClientConfiguration</literal>, together with any in <literal>CustomConfiguration</literal> (where the latter generally overrides the former).</simpara>
<warning>
<simpara>The <literal>CuostomConfiguration</literal> clas must be a <literal>@Configuration</literal> class, but take care that it is not in a <literal>@ComponentScan</literal> for the main application context.
Otherwise, it is shared by all the <literal>@RibbonClients</literal>. If you use <literal>@ComponentScan</literal> (or <literal>@SpringBootApplication</literal>), you need to take steps to avoid it being included (for instance, you can put it in a separate, non-overlapping package or specify the packages to scan explicitly in the <literal>@ComponentScan</literal>).</simpara>

<section xml:id="_using_ribbon_with_eureka">
<title>Using Ribbon with Eureka</title>
<simpara>When Eureka is used in conjunction with Ribbon (that is, both are on the classpath), the <literal>ribbonServerList</literal> is overridden with an extension of <literal>DiscoveryEnabledNIWSServerList</literal>, which populates the list of servers from Eureka.
It also replaces the <literal>IPing</literal> interface with <literal>NIWSDiscoveryPing</literal>, which delegates to Eureka to determine if a server is up.
The <literal>ServerList</literal> that is installed by default is a <literal>DomainExtractingServerList</literal>. Its purpose is to make metadata available to the load balancer without using AWS AMI metadata (which is what Netflix relies on).
By default, the server list is constructed with &#8220;zone&#8221; information, as provided in the instance metadata (so, on the remote clients, set <literal>eureka.instance.metadataMap.zone</literal>).
If that is missing and if the <literal>approximateZoneFromHostname</literal> flag is set, it can use the domain name from the server hostname as a proxy for the zone.
Once the zone information is available, it can be used in a <literal>ServerListFilter</literal>.
By default, it is used to locate a server in the same zone as the client, because the default is a <literal>ZonePreferenceServerListFilter</literal>.
By default, the zone of the client is determined in the same way as the remote instances (that is, through <literal>eureka.instance.metadataMap.zone</literal>).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The orthodox &#8220;archaius&#8221; way to set the client zone is through a configuration property called "@zone".
If it is available, Spring Cloud uses that in preference to all other settings (note that the key must be quoted in YAML configuration).</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>If there is no other source of zone data, then a guess is made, based on the client configuration (as opposed to the instance configuration).
We take <literal>eureka.client.availabilityZones</literal>, which is a map from region name to a list of zones, and pull out the first zone for the instance&#8217;s own region (that is, the <literal>eureka.client.region</literal>, which defaults to "us-east-1", for compatibility with native Netflix).</simpara>

Archaius is an extension of the <link xl:href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-configuration">Apache Commons Configuration</link> project.
It allows updates to configuration by either polling a source for changes or by letting a source push changes to the client.
Archaius uses Dynamic&lt;Type&gt;Property classes as handles to properties, as shown in the following example:</simpara>

<simpara>Archaius has its own set of configuration files and loading priorities.
Spring applications should generally not use Archaius directly, but the need to configure the Netflix tools natively remains.
Spring Cloud has a Spring Environment Bridge so that Archaius can read properties from the Spring Environment.

<simpara>To include Zuul in your project, use the starter with a group ID of <literal>org.springframework.cloud</literal> and a artifact ID of <literal>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-zuul</literal>.
See the <link xl:href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/">Spring Cloud Project page</link> for details on setting up your build system with the current Spring Cloud Release Train.</simpara>

<title>Embedded Zuul Reverse Proxy</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud has created an embedded Zuul proxy to ease the development of a common use case where a UI application wants to make proxy calls to one or more back end services.
This feature is useful for a user interface to proxy to the backend services it requires, avoiding the need to manage CORS and authentication concerns independently for all the backends.</simpara>
<simpara>To enable it, annotate a Spring Boot main class with <literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal>. Doing so causes local calls to be forwarded to the appropriate service.
By convention, a service with an ID of <literal>users</literal> receives requests from the proxy located at <literal>/users</literal> (with the prefix stripped).
The proxy uses Ribbon to locate an instance to which to forward through discovery.
All requests are executed in a <link linkend="hystrix-fallbacks-for-routes">hystrix command</link>, so failures appear in Hystrix metrics.
Once the circuit is open, the proxy does not try to contact the service.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>the Zuul starter does not include a discovery client, so, for routes based on service IDs, you need to provide one of those on the classpath as well (Eureka is one choice).</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>To skip having a service automatically added, set <literal>zuul.ignored-services</literal> to a list of service ID patterns.
If a service matches a pattern that is ignored but is also included in the explicitly configured routes map, it is unignored, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  ignoredServices: '*'
  routes:
    users: /myusers/**</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>In the preceding example, all services are ignored, <emphasis role="strong">except</emphasis> for <literal>users</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To augment or change the proxy routes, you can add external configuration, as follows:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    users: /myusers/**</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>The preceding example means that HTTP calls to <literal>/myusers</literal> get forwarded to the <literal>users</literal> service (for example <literal>/myusers/101</literal> is forwarded to <literal>/101</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>To get more fine-grained control over a route, you can specify the path and the serviceId independently, as follows:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
      serviceId: users_service</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>The preceding example means that HTTP calls to <literal>/myusers</literal> get forwarded to the <literal>users_service</literal> service.
The route must have a <literal>path</literal> that can be specified as an ant-style pattern, so <literal>/myusers/*</literal> only matches one level, but <literal>/myusers/**</literal> matches hierarchically.</simpara>
<simpara>The location of the backend can be specified as either a <literal>serviceId</literal> (for a service from discovery) or a <literal>url</literal> (for a physical location), as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
      url: http://example.com/users_service</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>These simple url-routes do not get executed as a <literal>HystrixCommand</literal>, nor do they load-balance multiple URLs with Ribbon.
To achieve those goals, you can specify a <literal>serviceId</literal> with a static list of servers, as follows:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">zuul:
  routes:
    echo:
      path: /myusers/**
      serviceId: myusers-service
      stripPrefix: true

hystrix:
  command:
    myusers-service:
      execution:
        isolation:
          thread:
            timeoutInMilliseconds: ...

myusers-service:
  ribbon:
    NIWSServerListClassName: com.netflix.loadbalancer.ConfigurationBasedServerList
    ListOfServers: http://example1.com,http://example2.com
    ConnectTimeout: 1000
    ReadTimeout: 3000
    MaxTotalHttpConnections: 500
    MaxConnectionsPerHost: 100</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Another method is specifiying a service-route and configuring a Ribbon client for the <literal>serviceId</literal> (doing so requires disabling Eureka support in Ribbon&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;see <link linkend="spring-cloud-ribbon-without-eureka">above for more information</link>), as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
      serviceId: users

ribbon:
  eureka:
    enabled: false

users:
  ribbon:
    listOfServers: example.com,google.com</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>You can provide a convention between <literal>serviceId</literal> and routes by using <literal>regexmapper</literal>.
It uses regular-expression named groups to extract variables from <literal>serviceId</literal> and inject them into a route pattern, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>ApplicationConfiguration.java</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public PatternServiceRouteMapper serviceRouteMapper() {
    return new PatternServiceRouteMapper(
        "(?&lt;name&gt;^.+)-(?&lt;version&gt;v.+$)",
        "${version}/${name}");
}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>The preceding example means that a <literal>serviceId</literal> of <literal>myusers-v1</literal> is mapped to route <literal>/v1/myusers/**</literal>.
Any regular expression is accepted, but all named groups must be present in both <literal>servicePattern</literal> and <literal>routePattern</literal>.
If <literal>servicePattern</literal> does not match a <literal>serviceId</literal>, the default behavior is used.
In the preceding example, a <literal>serviceId</literal> of <literal>myusers</literal> is mapped to the "/myusers/**" route (with no version detected).
This feature is disabled by default and only applies to discovered services.</simpara>
<simpara>To add a prefix to all mappings, set <literal>zuul.prefix</literal> to a value, such as <literal>/api</literal>.
By default, the proxy prefix is stripped from the request before the request is forwarded by (you can switch this behavior off with <literal>zuul.stripPrefix=false</literal>).
You can also switch off the stripping of the service-specific prefix from individual routes, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
      stripPrefix: false</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<note>
<simpara><literal>zuul.stripPrefix</literal> only applies to the prefix set in <literal>zuul.prefix</literal>.
It does not have any effect on prefixes defined within a given route&#8217;s <literal>path</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>In the preceding example, requests to <literal>/myusers/101</literal> are forwarded to <literal>/myusers/101</literal> on the <literal>users</literal> service.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>zuul.routes</literal> entries actually bind to an object of type <literal>ZuulProperties</literal>.
If you look at the properties of that object, you can see that it also has a <literal>retryable</literal> flag.
Set that flag to <literal>true</literal> to have the Ribbon client automatically retry failed requests.
You can also set that flag to <literal>true</literal> when you need to modify the parameters of the retry operations that use the Ribbon client configuration.</simpara>
<simpara>By default, the <literal>X-Forwarded-Host</literal> header is added to the forwarded requests.
To turn it off, set <literal>zuul.addProxyHeaders = false</literal>.
By default, the prefix path is stripped, and the request to the backend picks up a <literal>X-Forwarded-Prefix</literal> header (<literal>/myusers</literal> in the examples shown earlier).</simpara>
<simpara>If you set a default route (<literal>/</literal>), an application with <literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal> could act as a standalone server. For example, <literal>zuul.route.home: /</literal> would route all traffic ("/**") to the "home" service.</simpara>
<simpara>If more fine-grained ignoring is needed, you can specify specific patterns to ignore.
These patterns are evaluated at the start of the route location process, which means prefixes should be included in the pattern to warrant a match.
Ignored patterns span all services and supersede any other route specification.
The following example shows how to create ignored patterns:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  ignoredPatterns: /**/admin/**
  routes:
    users: /myusers/**</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>The preceding example means that all calls (such as <literal>/myusers/101</literal>) are forwarded to <literal>/101</literal> on the <literal>users</literal> service.
However, calls including <literal>/admin/</literal> do not resolve.</simpara>
<warning>
<simpara>If you need your routes to have their order preserved, you need to use a YAML file, as the ordering is lost when using a properties file.
The following example shows such a YAML file:</simpara>
</warning>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
    legacy:
      path: /**</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>If you were to use a properties file, the <literal>legacy</literal> path might end up in front of the <literal>users</literal>
path, rendering the <literal>users</literal> path unreachable.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_zuul_http_client">
<title>Zuul Http Client</title>
<simpara>The default HTTP client used by Zuul is now backed by the Apache HTTP Client instead of the deprecated Ribbon <literal>RestClient</literal>.
To use <literal>RestClient</literal> or <literal>okhttp3.OkHttpClient</literal>, set <literal>ribbon.restclient.enabled=true</literal> or <literal>ribbon.okhttp.enabled=true</literal>, respectively.
If you would like to customize the Apache HTTP client or the OK HTTP client, provide a bean of type <literal>ClosableHttpClient</literal> or <literal>OkHttpClient</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_cookies_and_sensitive_headers">
<title>Cookies and Sensitive Headers</title>
<simpara>You can share headers between services in the same system, but you probably do not want sensitive headers leaking downstream into external servers.
You can specify a list of ignored headers as part of the route configuration.
Cookies play a special role, because they have well defined semantics in browsers, and they are always to be treated as sensitive.
If the consumer of your proxy is a browser, then cookies for downstream services also cause problems for the user, because they all get jumbled up together (all downstream services look like they come from the same place).</simpara>
<simpara>If you are careful with the design of your services, (for example, if only one of the downstream services sets cookies), you might be able to let them flow from the backend all the way up to the caller.
Also, if your proxy sets cookies and all your back-end services are part of the same system, it can be natural to simply share them (and, for instance, use Spring Session to link them up to some shared state).
Other than that, any cookies that get set by downstream services are likely to be not useful to the caller, so it is recommended that you make (at least) <literal>Set-Cookie</literal> and <literal>Cookie</literal> into sensitive headers for routes that are not part of your domain.
Even for routes that are part of your domain, try to think carefully about what it means before letting cookies flow between them and the proxy.</simpara>
<simpara>The sensitive headers can be configured as a comma-separated list per route, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
      sensitiveHeaders: Cookie,Set-Cookie,Authorization
      url: https://downstream</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<note>
<simpara>This is the default value for <literal>sensitiveHeaders</literal>, so you need not set it unless you want it to be different.
This is new in Spring Cloud Netflix 1.1 (in 1.0, the user had no control over headers, and all cookies flowed in both directions).</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>The <literal>sensitiveHeaders</literal> are a blacklist, and the default is not empty.
Consequently, to make Zuul send all headers (except the <literal>ignored</literal> ones), you must explicitly set it to the empty list.
Doing so is necessary if you want to pass cookie or authorization headers to your back end. The following example shows how to use <literal>sensitiveHeaders</literal>:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
      sensitiveHeaders:
      url: https://downstream</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>You can also set sensitive headers, by setting <literal>zuul.sensitiveHeaders</literal>.
If <literal>sensitiveHeaders</literal> is set on a route, it overrides the global <literal>sensitiveHeaders</literal> setting.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_ignored_headers">
<title>Ignored Headers</title>
<simpara>In addition to the route-sensitive headers, you can set a global value called <literal>zuul.ignoredHeaders</literal> for values (both request and response) that should be discarded during interactions with downstream services.
By default, if Spring Security is not on the classpath, these are empty.
Otherwise, they are initialized to a set of well known &#8220;security&#8221; headers (for example, involving caching) as specified by Spring Security.
The assumption in this case is that the downstream services might add these headers, too, but we want the values from the proxy.
To not discard these well known security headers when Spring Security is on the classpath, you can set <literal>zuul.ignoreSecurityHeaders</literal> to <literal>false</literal>.
Doing so can be useful if you disabled the HTTP Security response headers in Spring Security and want the values provided by downstream services.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_management_endpoints">
<title>Management Endpoints</title>
<simpara>By default, if you use <literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal> with the Spring Boot Actuator, you enable two additional endpoints:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Routes</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Filters</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<section xml:id="_routes_endpoint">
<title>Routes Endpoint</title>
<simpara>A GET to the routes endpoint at <literal>/routes</literal> returns a list of the mapped routes:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>GET /routes</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
  /stores/**: "http://localhost:8081"
}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Additional route details can be requested by adding the <literal>?format=details</literal> query string to <literal>/routes</literal>.
Doing so produces the following output:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>GET /routes/details</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
  "/stores/**": {
    "id": "stores",

    "retryable": false,
    "customSensitiveHeaders": false,
    "prefixStripped": true
  }
}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>A <literal>POST</literal> to <literal>/routes</literal> forces a refresh of the existing routes (for example, when there have been changes in the service catalog).
You can disable this endpoint by setting <literal>endpoints.routes.enabled</literal> to <literal>false</literal>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>the routes should respond automatically to changes in the service catalog, but the <literal>POST</literal> to <literal>/routes</literal> is a way to force the change
to happen immediately.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_filters_endpoint">
<title>Filters Endpoint</title>
<simpara>A <literal>GET</literal> to the filters endpoint at <literal>/filters</literal> returns a map of Zuul filters by type.
For each filter type in the map, you get a list of all the filters of that type, along with their details.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="_strangulation_patterns_and_local_forwards">
<title>Strangulation Patterns and Local Forwards</title>
<simpara>A common pattern when migrating an existing application or API is to &#8220;strangle&#8221; old endpoints, slowly replacing them with different implementations.
The Zuul proxy is a useful tool for this because you can use it to handle all traffic from the clients of the old endpoints but redirect some of the requests to new ones.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows the configuration details for a &#8220;strangle&#8221; scenario:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    first:
      path: /first/**
      url: http://first.example.com
    second:
      path: /second/**
      url: forward:/second
    third:
      path: /third/**
      url: forward:/3rd
    legacy:
      path: /**
      url: http://legacy.example.com</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>In the preceding example, we are strangle the &#8220;legacy&#8221; application, which is mapped to all requests that do not match one of the other patterns.
Paths in <literal>/first/**</literal> have been extracted into a new service with an external URL.
Paths in <literal>/second/**</literal> are forwarded so that they can be handled locally (for example, with a normal Spring <literal>@RequestMapping</literal>).
Paths in <literal>/third/**</literal> are also forwarded but with a different prefix (<literal>/third/foo</literal> is forwarded to <literal>/3rd/foo</literal>).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The ignored patterns aren&#8217;t completely ignored, they just are not handled by the proxy (so they are also effectively forwarded locally).</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_uploading_files_through_zuul">
<title>Uploading Files through Zuul</title>
<simpara>If you use <literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal>, you can use the proxy paths to upload files and it should work, so long as the files are small.
For large files there is an alternative path that bypasses the Spring <literal>DispatcherServlet</literal> (to avoid multipart processing) in "/zuul/*".
In other words, if you have <literal>zuul.routes.customers=/customers/**</literal>, then you can <literal>POST</literal> large files to <literal>/zuul/customers/*</literal>.
The servlet path is externalized via <literal>zuul.servletPath</literal>.
If the proxy route takes you through a Ribbon load balancer, extremely large files also require elevated timeout settings, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">hystrix.command.default.execution.isolation.thread.timeoutInMilliseconds: 60000
ribbon:
  ConnectTimeout: 3000
  ReadTimeout: 60000</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Note that, for streaming to work with large files, you need to use chunked encoding in the request (which some browsers do not do by default), as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ curl -v -H "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" \
    -F "file=@mylarge.iso" localhost:9999/zuul/simple/file</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_query_string_encoding">
<title>Query String Encoding</title>
<simpara>When processing the incoming request, query params are decoded so that they can be available for possible modifications in Zuul filters.
They are then re-encoded the backend request is rebuilt in the route filters.
The result can be different than the original input if (for example) it was encoded with Javascript&#8217;s <literal>encodeURIComponent()</literal> method.
While this causes no issues in most cases, some web servers can be picky with the encoding of complex query string.</simpara>
<simpara>To force the original encoding of the query string, it is possible to pass a special flag to <literal>ZuulProperties</literal> so that the query string is taken as is with the <literal>HttpServletRequest::getQueryString</literal> method, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  forceOriginalQueryStringEncoding: true</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<note>
<simpara>This special flag works only with <literal>SimpleHostRoutingFilter</literal>. Also, you loose the ability to easily override
query parameters with <literal>RequestContext.getCurrentContext().setRequestQueryParams(someOverriddenParameters)</literal>, because
the query string is now fetched directly on the original <literal>HttpServletRequest</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_plain_embedded_zuul">
<title>Plain Embedded Zuul</title>
<simpara>If you use <literal>@EnableZuulServer</literal> (instead of <literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal>), you can also run a Zuul server without proxying or selectively switch on parts of the proxying platform.
Any beans that you add to the application of type <literal>ZuulFilter</literal> are installed automatically (as they are with <literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal>) but without any of the proxy filters being added automatically.</simpara>
<simpara>In that case, the routes into the Zuul server are still specified by configuring "zuul.routes.*", but there is no service discovery and no proxying. Consequently, the "serviceId" and "url" settings are ignored.
The following example maps all paths in "/api/**" to the Zuul filter chain:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:

<section xml:id="_disable_zuul_filters">
<title>Disable Zuul Filters</title>
<simpara>Zuul for Spring Cloud comes with a number of <literal>ZuulFilter</literal> beans enabled by default in both proxy and server mode.
See <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/tree/master/spring-cloud-netflix-zuul/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/netflix/zuul/filters">the Zuul filters package</link> for the list of filters that you can enable.
If you want to disable one, set <literal>zuul.&lt;SimpleClassName&gt;.&lt;filterType&gt;.disable=true</literal>.
By convention, the package after <literal>filters</literal> is the Zuul filter type.
For example to disable <literal>org.springframework.cloud.netflix.zuul.filters.post.SendResponseFilter</literal>, set <literal>zuul.SendResponseFilter.post.disable=true</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="hystrix-fallbacks-for-routes">
<title>Providing Hystrix Fallbacks For Routes</title>
<simpara>When a circuit for a given route in Zuul is tripped, you can provide a fallback response by creating a bean of type <literal>FallbackProvider</literal>.
Within this bean, you need to specify the route ID the fallback is for and provide a <literal>ClientHttpResponse</literal> to return as a fallback.
The following example shows a relatively simple <literal>FallbackProvider</literal> implementation:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">class MyFallbackProvider implements FallbackProvider {

    @Override
    public String getRoute() {
        return "customers";
    }

    @Override
    public ClientHttpResponse fallbackResponse(String route, final Throwable cause) {
        if (cause instanceof HystrixTimeoutException) {
            return response(HttpStatus.GATEWAY_TIMEOUT);
        } else {
            return response(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
        }
    }

    private ClientHttpResponse response(final HttpStatus status) {
        return new ClientHttpResponse() {
            @Override
            public HttpStatus getStatusCode() throws IOException {
                return status;
            }

            @Override
            public int getRawStatusCode() throws IOException {
                return status.value();
            }

            @Override
            public String getStatusText() throws IOException {
                return status.getReasonPhrase();
            }

            @Override
            public void close() {
            }

            @Override
            public InputStream getBody() throws IOException {
                return new ByteArrayInputStream("fallback".getBytes());
            }

            @Override
            public HttpHeaders getHeaders() {
                HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
                headers.setContentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);
                return headers;
            }
        };
    }

<simpara>The following example shows how the route configuration for the previous example might appear:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">zuul:

<simpara>If you would like to provide a default fallback for all routes, you can create a bean of type <literal>FallbackProvider</literal> and have the <literal>getRoute</literal> method return <literal>*</literal> or <literal>null</literal>, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">class MyFallbackProvider implements FallbackProvider {

<title>Rewriting the <literal>Location</literal> header</title>
<simpara>If Zuul is fronting a web application, you may need to re-write the <literal>Location</literal> header when the web application redirects through a HTTP status code of <literal>3XX</literal>.
Otherwise, the browser redirects to the web application&#8217;s URL instead of the Zuul URL.
You can configure a <literal>LocationRewriteFilter</literal> Zuul filter to re-write the <literal>Location</literal> header to the Zuul&#8217;s URL.
It also adds back the stripped global and route-specific prefixes.
The following example adds a filter by using a Spring Configuration file:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.zuul.filters.post.LocationRewriteFilter;
...

@Configuration
@EnableZuulProxy
public class ZuulConfig {
    @Bean
    public LocationRewriteFilter locationRewriteFilter() {
        return new LocationRewriteFilter();
    }
}</programlisting>
<caution>
<simpara>Use this filter carefully. The filter acts on the <literal>Location</literal> header of ALL <literal>3XX</literal> response codes, which may not be appropriate in all scenarios, such as when redirecting the user to an external URL.</simpara>

<title>The Zuul Servlet</title>
<simpara>Zuul is implemented as a Servlet. For the general cases, Zuul is embedded into the Spring Dispatch mechanism. This lets Spring MVC be in control of the routing.
In this case, Zuul buffers requests.
If there is a need to go through Zuul without buffering requests (for example, for large file uploads), the Servlet is also installed outside of the Spring Dispatcher.
By default, the servlet has an address of <literal>/zuul</literal>.
This path can be changed with the <literal>zuul.servlet-path</literal> property.</simpara>

<simpara>Pre filters set up data in the <literal>RequestContext</literal> for use in filters downstream.
The main use case is to set information required for route filters.
The following example shows a Zuul pre filter:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public class QueryParamPreFilter extends ZuulFilter {

<simpara>The preceding filter populates <literal>SERVICE_ID_KEY</literal> from the <literal>sample</literal> request parameter.

<title>Polyglot support with Sidecar</title>
<simpara>Do you have non-JVM languages with which you want to take advantage of Eureka, Ribbon, and Config Server?
The Spring Cloud Netflix Sidecar was inspired by <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/Prana">Netflix Prana</link>.
It includes an HTTP API to get all of the instances (by host and port) for a given service.
You can also proxy service calls through an embedded Zuul proxy that gets its route entries from Eureka.
The Spring Cloud Config Server can be accessed directly through host lookup or through the Zuul Proxy.
The non-JVM application should implement a health check so the Sidecar can report to Eureka whether the app is up or down.</simpara>
<simpara>To include Sidecar in your project, use the dependency with a group ID of <literal>org.springframework.cloud</literal>
and artifact ID or <literal>spring-cloud-netflix-sidecar</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To enable the Sidecar, create a Spring Boot application with <literal>@EnableSidecar</literal>.
This annotation includes <literal>@EnableCircuitBreaker</literal>, <literal>@EnableDiscoveryClient</literal>, and <literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal>.
Run the resulting application on the same host as the non-JVM application.</simpara>
<simpara>To configure the side car, add <literal>sidecar.port</literal> and <literal>sidecar.health-uri</literal> to <literal>application.yml</literal>.
The <literal>sidecar.port</literal> property is the port on which the non-JVM application listens.
This is so the Sidecar can properly register the application with Eureka.
The <literal>sidecar.health-uri</literal> is a URI accessible on the non-JVM application that mimics a Spring Boot health indicator.
It should return a JSON document that resembles the following:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>health-uri-document</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
  "status":"UP"

<simpara>This API is accessible to the non-JVM application (if the sidecar is on port 5678) at <literal><link xl:href="http://localhost:5678/hosts/{serviceId}">http://localhost:5678/hosts/{serviceId}</link></literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>The Zuul proxy automatically adds routes for each service known in Eureka to <literal>/&lt;serviceId&gt;</literal>, so the customers service is available at <literal>/customers</literal>.
The non-JVM application can access the customer service at <literal><link xl:href="http://localhost:5678/customers">http://localhost:5678/customers</link></literal> (assuming the sidecar is listening on port 5678).</simpara>

<simpara>Non-JVM applications can take advantage of the Config Server&#8217;s ability to return YAML documents.

<title>Metrics: Spectator, Servo, and Atlas</title>
<simpara>When used together, Spectator (or Servo) and Atlas provide a near real-time operational insight platform.
Spectator and Servo are Netflix&#8217;s metrics collection libraries.
Atlas is a Netflix metrics backend that manages dimensional time-series data.</simpara>
<simpara>Servo served Netflix for several years and is still usable but is gradually being phased out in favor of Spectator, which is designed to work only with Java 8.
Spring Cloud Netflix provides support for both, but Java 8-based applications are encouraged to use Spectator.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_dimensional_versus_hierarchical_metrics">
<title>Dimensional Versus Hierarchical Metrics</title>
<simpara>Spring Boot Actuator metrics are hierarchical, and the metrics are separated only by name.
These names often follow a naming convention that embeds key/value attribute pairs (dimensions) into the name (separated by periods).
Consider the following metrics for two endpoints, <literal>root</literal> and <literal>star-star</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
    "counter.status.200.root": 20,
    "counter.status.400.root": 3,
    "counter.status.200.star-star": 5,
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The first metric gives us a normalized count of successful requests against the root endpoint per unit of time.
But what if the system has 20 endpoints and you want to get a count of successful requests against all the endpoints?
Some hierarchical metrics backends would let you specify a wildcard, such as <literal>counter.status.200.*</literal>, that would read all 20 metrics and aggregate the results.
Alternatively, you could provide a <literal>HandlerInterceptorAdapter</literal> that intercepts and records a metric such as <literal>counter.status.200.all</literal> for all successful requests irrespective of the endpoint, but now you must write 20+1 different metrics.
Similarly, if you want to know the total number of successful requests for all endpoints in the service, you could specify a wildcard such as <literal>counter.status.2*.*</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Even in the presence of wildcarding support on a hierarchical metrics backend, naming consistency can be difficult.
Specifically, the position of these tags in the name string can slip with time, breaking queries.
For example, suppose we add an additional dimension to the earlier hierarchical metrics for an HTTP method.
Then <literal>counter.status.200.root</literal> becomes <literal>counter.status.200.method.get.root</literal> (or <literal>post</literal> and so on).
Suddenly, Our <literal>counter.status.200.*</literal> no longer has the same semantic meaning.
Furthermore, if the new dimension is not applied uniformly across the codebase, certain queries may become impossible.
This can quickly get out of hand.</simpara>
<simpara>Netflix metrics are tagged (in other words, they are dimensional).
Each metric has a name, but this single named metric can contain multiple statistics and 'tag' key/value pairs, which allows more querying flexibility.
In fact, the statistics themselves are recorded in a special tag.</simpara>
<simpara>When recorded with Netflix Servo or Spectator, a timer for the root endpoint described earlier contains four statistics for each status code, where the count statistic is identical to Spring Boot Actuator&#8217;s counter.
When we have encountered an HTTP 200 and 400 with the preceding examples, there are eight available data points, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
    "root(status=200,stastic=count)": 20,
    "root(status=200,stastic=max)": 0.7265630630000001,
    "root(status=200,stastic=totalOfSquares)": 0.04759702862580789,
    "root(status=200,stastic=totalTime)": 0.2093076914666667,
    "root(status=400,stastic=count)": 1,
    "root(status=400,stastic=max)": 0,
    "root(status=400,stastic=totalOfSquares)": 0,

<section xml:id="netflix-metrics-spectator">
<title>Metrics Collection: Spectator</title>
<simpara>To enable Spectator metrics, include a dependency on <literal>spring-boot-starter-spectator</literal>, as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-starter-netflix-spectator&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>In Spectator parlance, a meter is a named, typed, and tagged configuration, while a metric represents the value of a given meter at a point in time.
Spectator meters are created and controlled by a registry, which currently has several different implementations.
Spectator provides four meter types: counter, timer, gauge, and distribution summary.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Spectator integration configures an injectable <literal>com.netflix.spectator.api.Registry</literal> instance for you.
Specifically, it configures a <literal>ServoRegistry</literal> instance in order to unify the collection of REST metrics and the exporting of metrics to the Atlas backend under a single Servo API.
Practically, this means that your code may use a mixture of Servo monitors and Spectator meters.
Spring Boot scoops up both Actuator <literal>MetricReader</literal> instances and ships them to the Atlas backend.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_spectator_counter">
<title>Spectator Counter</title>
<simpara>A counter measures the rate at which some event is occurring, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// create a counter with a name and a set of tags
Counter counter = registry.counter("counterName", "tagKey1", "tagValue1", ...);
counter.increment(); // increment when an event occurs
counter.increment(10); // increment by a discrete amount</programlisting>
<simpara>The counter records a single time-normalized statistic.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_spectator_timer">
<title>Spectator Timer</title>
<simpara>A timer measures how long some event takes.
Spring Cloud automatically records timers for Spring MVC requests and, conditionally, <literal>RestTemplate</literal> requests, which can later be used to create dashboards for request related metrics like latency, as shown in the following example:</simpara>

</mediaobject>
</figure>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// create a timer with a name and a set of tags
Timer timer = registry.timer("timerName", "tagKey1", "tagValue1", ...);

// execute an operation and time it at the same time
T result = timer.record(() -&gt; fooReturnsT());

// alternatively, if you must manually record the time
Long start = System.nanoTime();
T result = fooReturnsT();
timer.record(System.nanoTime() - start, TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS);</programlisting>
<simpara>The timer simultaneously records four statistics: <literal>count</literal>, <literal>max</literal>, <literal>totalOfSquares</literal>, and <literal>totalTime</literal>.
The count statistic always matches the single normalized value provided by a counter as though you had called <literal>increment()</literal> once on the counter for each time you recorded a timing, so it is rarely necessary to count and time separately for a single operation.</simpara>
<simpara>For <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/spectator/wiki/Timer-Usage#longtasktimer">long-running operations</link>, Spectator provides a special <literal>LongTaskTimer</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_spectator_gauge">
<title>Spectator Gauge</title>
<simpara>Gauges show some current value, such as the size of a queue or number of threads in a running state.
Since gauges are sampled, they provide no information about how these values fluctuate between samples.</simpara>
<simpara>The normal use of a gauge involves registering the gauge once on initialization with an ID, a reference to the object to be sampled, and a function to get or compute a numeric value based on the object.
The reference to the object is passed in separately, and the Spectator registry keeps a weak reference to the object.
If the object is garbage collected, Spectator automatically drops the registration.
See <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/spectator/wiki/Gauge-Usage#using-lambda">the note</link> in Spectator&#8217;s documentation about potential memory leaks if this API is misused.
The following listing shows how to automatically and manually sample a gauge:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// the registry automatically samples this gauge periodically
registry.gauge("gaugeName", pool, Pool::numberOfRunningThreads);

// manually sample a value in code at periodic intervals -- last resort!
registry.gauge("gaugeName", Arrays.asList("tagKey1", "tagValue1", ...), 1000);</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_spectator_distribution_summaries">
<title>Spectator Distribution Summaries</title>
<simpara>A distribution summary tracks the distribution of events.
It is similar to a timer but more general in that the size does not have to be a period of time.
For example, a distribution summary could be used to measure the payload sizes of requests hitting a server.
The following example defines a distribution summary:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// the registry automatically samples this gauge periodically
DistributionSummary ds = registry.distributionSummary("dsName", "tagKey1", "tagValue1", ...);
ds.record(request.sizeInBytes());</programlisting>

<section xml:id="netflix-metrics-servo">
<title>Metrics Collection: Servo</title>
<note>
<simpara>If your code is compiled on Java 8, use Spectator instead of Servo, as Spectator is destined to replace Servo entirely.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>In Servo parlance, a monitor is a named, typed, and tagged configuration, and a metric represents the value of a given monitor at a point in time.
Servo monitors are logically equivalent to Spectator meters.
Servo monitors are created and controlled by a <literal>MonitorRegistry</literal>.
While it is still available, Servo has a <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/servo/wiki/Getting-Started">wider array</link> of monitor options than Spectator has meters.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud integration configures an injectable <literal>com.netflix.servo.MonitorRegistry</literal> instance for you.
Once you have created the appropriate <literal>Monitor</literal> type in Servo, the process of recording data is similar to that of Spectator.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_creating_servo_monitors">
<title>Creating Servo Monitors</title>
<simpara>If you use the Servo <literal>MonitorRegistry</literal> instance provided by Spring Cloud (specifically, an instance of <literal>DefaultMonitorRegistry</literal>), Servo provides convenience classes for retrieving <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/spectator/wiki/Servo-Comparison#dynamiccounter">counters</link> and <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/spectator/wiki/Servo-Comparison#dynamictimer">timers</link>.
These convenience classes ensure that only one <literal>Monitor</literal> is registered for each unique combination of name and tags.</simpara>
<simpara>To manually create a Monitor type in Servo, especially for the more exotic monitor types for which convenience methods are not provided, instantiate the appropriate type by providing a <literal>MonitorConfig</literal> instance, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">MonitorConfig config = MonitorConfig.builder("timerName").withTag("tagKey1", "tagValue1").build();

// somewhere we should cache this Monitor by MonitorConfig

<simpara>Atlas captures operational intelligence.
Whereas business intelligence is data gathered for analyzing trends over time, operational intelligence provides a picture of what is currently happening within a system.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud provides a <literal>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-atlas</literal> that has all the dependencies you need.

$ java -jar atlas-1.4.2-standalone.jar</programlisting>
<tip>
<simpara>An Atlas standalone node running on an r3.2xlarge (61GB RAM) can handle roughly 2 million metrics per minute for a given six-hour window.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>Once the application is running and you have collected a handful of metrics, you can verify that your setup is correct by listing tags on the Atlas server, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ curl http://ATLAS/api/v1/tags</programlisting>
<tip>
<simpara>After running several requests against your service, you can gather some basic information on the request latency of every request by pasting the following URL in your browser: <literal><link xl:href="http://ATLAS/api/v1/graph?q=name,rest,:eq,:avg">http://ATLAS/api/v1/graph?q=name,rest,:eq,:avg</link></literal></simpara>

<chapter xml:id="retrying-failed-requests">
<title>Retrying Failed Requests</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Netflix offers a variety of ways to make HTTP requests.
You can use a load balanced <literal>RestTemplate</literal>, Ribbon, or Feign.
No matter how you choose to create your HTTP requests, there is always a chance that a request may fail.
When a request fails, you may want to have the request be retried automatically.
To do so when using Sping Cloud Netflix, you need to include <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry">Spring Retry</link> on your application&#8217;s classpath.
When Spring Retry is present, load-balanced <literal>RestTemplates</literal>, Feign, and Zuul automatically retry any failed requests (assuming your configuration allows doing so).</simpara>
<section xml:id="_backoff_policies">
<title>BackOff Policies</title>
<simpara>By default, no backoff policy is used when retrying requests.
If you would like to configure a backoff policy, you need to create a bean of type <literal>LoadBalancedBackOffPolicyFactory</literal>, which is used to create a <literal>BackOffPolicy</literal> for a given service, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {
    @Bean
    LoadBalancedBackOffPolicyFactory backOffPolicyFactory() {
        return new LoadBalancedBackOffPolicyFactory() {

            public BackOffPolicy createBackOffPolicy(String service) {
                return new ExponentialBackOffPolicy();
            }
        };
    }
}</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_configuration">
<title>Configuration</title>
<simpara>When you use Ribbon with Spring Retry, you can control the retry functionality by configuring certain Ribbon properties.
To do so, set the <literal>client.ribbon.MaxAutoRetries</literal>, <literal>client.ribbon.MaxAutoRetriesNextServer</literal>, and <literal>client.ribbon.OkToRetryOnAllOperations</literal> properties.
See the <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon/wiki/Getting-Started#the-properties-file-sample-clientproperties">Ribbon documentation</link> for a description of what these properties do.</simpara>
<warning>
<simpara>Enabling <literal>client.ribbon.OkToRetryOnAllOperations</literal> includes retrying POST requests, which can have an impact
on the server&#8217;s resources, due to the buffering of the request body.</simpara>
</warning>
<simpara>In addition, you may want to retry requests when certain status codes are returned in the response.
You can list the response codes you would like the Ribbon client to retry by setting the <literal>clientName.ribbon.retryableStatusCodes</literal> property, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">clientName:
  ribbon:
    retryableStatusCodes: 404,502</programlisting>
<simpara>You can also create a bean of type <literal>LoadBalancedRetryPolicy</literal> and implement the <literal>retryableStatusCode</literal> method to retry a request given the status code.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_zuul">
<title>Zuul</title>
<simpara>You can turn off Zuul&#8217;s retry functionality by setting <literal>zuul.retryable</literal> to <literal>false</literal>.
You can also disable retry functionality on a route-by-route basis by setting <literal>zuul.routes.routename.retryable</literal> to <literal>false</literal>.</simpara>

However, you can also provide your own HTTP clients customized as you need them to be.
To do so, you can create a bean of type <literal>ClosableHttpClient</literal> if you
are using the Apache Http Cient or <literal>OkHttpClient</literal> if you are using OK HTTP.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>When you create your own HTTP client, you are also responsible for implementing the correct connection management strategies for these clients.

<title>Declarative REST Client: Feign</title>
<simpara><link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/feign">Feign</link> is a declarative web service client.  It makes writing web service clients easier.  To use Feign create an interface and annotate it.  It has pluggable annotation support including Feign annotations and JAX-RS annotations. Feign also supports pluggable encoders and decoders.  Spring Cloud adds support for Spring MVC annotations and for using the same <literal>HttpMessageConverters</literal> used by default in Spring Web.  Spring Cloud integrates Ribbon and Eureka to provide a load balanced http client when using Feign.</simpara>
<section xml:id="netflix-feign-starter">
<title>How to Include Feign</title>

<simpara>Example spring boot app</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication

    Store update(@PathVariable("storeId") Long storeId, Store store);
}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>In the <literal>@FeignClient</literal> annotation the String value ("stores" above) is
an arbitrary client name, which is used to create a Ribbon load
balancer (see <link linkend="spring-cloud-ribbon">below for details of Ribbon
support</link>). You can also specify a URL using the <literal>url</literal> attribute
(absolute value or just a hostname). The name of the bean in the
application context is the fully qualified name of the interface.
To specify your own alias value you can use the <literal>qualifier</literal> value
of the <literal>@FeignClient</literal> annotation.</simpara>
<simpara>The Ribbon client above will want to discover the physical addresses
for the "stores" service. If your application is a Eureka client then
it will resolve the service in the Eureka service registry. If you
don&#8217;t want to use Eureka, you can simply configure a list of servers
in your external configuration (see
<link linkend="spring-cloud-ribbon-without-eureka">above for example</link>).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="spring-cloud-feign-overriding-defaults">
<title>Overriding Feign Defaults</title>
<simpara>A central concept in Spring Cloud&#8217;s Feign support is that of the named client. Each feign client is part of an ensemble of components that work together to contact a remote server on demand, and the ensemble has a name that you give it as an application developer using the <literal>@FeignClient</literal> annotation. Spring Cloud creates a new ensemble as an
<literal>ApplicationContext</literal> on demand for each named client using <literal>FeignClientsConfiguration</literal>. This contains (amongst other things) an <literal>feign.Decoder</literal>, a <literal>feign.Encoder</literal>, and a <literal>feign.Contract</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud lets you take full control of the feign client by declaring additional configuration (on top of the <literal>FeignClientsConfiguration</literal>) using <literal>@FeignClient</literal>. Example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@FeignClient(name = "stores", configuration = FooConfiguration.class)
public interface StoreClient {
    //..
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In this case the client is composed from the components already in <literal>FeignClientsConfiguration</literal> together with any in <literal>FooConfiguration</literal> (where the latter will override the former).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara><literal>FooConfiguration</literal> does not need to be annotated with <literal>@Configuration</literal>. However, if it is, then take care to exclude it from any <literal>@ComponentScan</literal> that would otherwise include this configuration as it will become the default source for <literal>feign.Decoder</literal>, <literal>feign.Encoder</literal>, <literal>feign.Contract</literal>, etc., when specified. This can be avoided by putting it in a separate, non-overlapping package from any <literal>@ComponentScan</literal> or <literal>@SpringBootApplication</literal>, or it can be explicitly excluded in <literal>@ComponentScan</literal>.</simpara>

<note>
<simpara>The <literal>serviceId</literal> attribute is now deprecated in favor of the <literal>name</literal> attribute.</simpara>
</note>

<simpara>Creating a bean of one of those type and placing it in a <literal>@FeignClient</literal> configuration (such as <literal>FooConfiguration</literal> above) allows you to override each one of the beans described.  Example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Configuration

<simpara>This replaces the <literal>SpringMvcContract</literal> with <literal>feign.Contract.Default</literal> and adds a <literal>RequestInterceptor</literal> to the collection of <literal>RequestInterceptor</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>@FeignClient</literal> also can be configured using configuration properties.</simpara>

<title>Creating Feign Clients Manually</title>
<simpara>In some cases it might be necessary to customize your Feign Clients in a way that is not
possible using the methods above.  In this case you can create Clients using the
<link xl:href="https://github.com/OpenFeign/feign/#basics">Feign Builder API</link>. Below is an example
which creates two Feign Clients with the same interface but configures each one with
a separate request interceptor.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Import(FeignClientsConfiguration.class)
class FooController {

	private FooClient fooClient;

	private FooClient adminClient;

    	@Autowired
	public FooController(
			Decoder decoder, Encoder encoder, Client client, Contract contract) {
		this.fooClient = Feign.builder().client(client)
				.encoder(encoder)
				.decoder(decoder)
                .contract(contract)
				.requestInterceptor(new BasicAuthRequestInterceptor("user", "user"))
				.target(FooClient.class, "http://PROD-SVC");
		this.adminClient = Feign.builder().client(client)
				.encoder(encoder)
				.decoder(decoder)
				.contract(contract)
				.requestInterceptor(new BasicAuthRequestInterceptor("admin", "admin"))
				.target(FooClient.class, "http://PROD-SVC");
    }
}</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>In the above example <literal>FeignClientsConfiguration.class</literal> is the default configuration
provided by Spring Cloud Netflix.</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara><literal>PROD-SVC</literal> is the name of the service the Clients will be making requests to.</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>The Feign <literal>Contract</literal> object defines what annotations and values are valid on interfaces. The
autowired <literal>Contract</literal> bean provides supports for SpringMVC annotations, instead of
the default Feign native annotations.</simpara>

<section xml:id="spring-cloud-feign-hystrix">
<title>Feign Hystrix Support</title>
<simpara>If Hystrix is on the classpath and <literal>feign.hystrix.enabled=true</literal>, Feign will wrap all methods with a circuit breaker. Returning a <literal>com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixCommand</literal> is also available. This lets you use reactive patterns (with a call to <literal>.toObservable()</literal> or <literal>.observe()</literal> or asynchronous use (with a call to <literal>.queue()</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>To disable Hystrix support on a per-client basis create a vanilla <literal>Feign.Builder</literal> with the "prototype" scope, e.g.:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Configuration
public class FooConfiguration {
    	@Bean
	@Scope("prototype")
	public Feign.Builder feignBuilder() {
		return Feign.builder();
	}
}</programlisting>
<warning>
<simpara>Prior to the Spring Cloud Dalston release, if Hystrix was on the classpath Feign would have wrapped
all methods in a circuit breaker by default.  This default behavior was changed in Spring Cloud Dalston in
favor for an opt-in approach.</simpara>
</warning>
</section>
<section xml:id="spring-cloud-feign-hystrix-fallback">
<title>Feign Hystrix Fallbacks</title>
<simpara>Hystrix supports the notion of a fallback: a default code path that is executed when they circuit is open or there is an error. To enable fallbacks for a given <literal>@FeignClient</literal> set the <literal>fallback</literal> attribute to the class name that implements the fallback. You also need to declare your implementation as a Spring bean.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@FeignClient(name = "hello", fallback = HystrixClientFallback.class)
protected interface HystrixClient {
    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value = "/hello")
    Hello iFailSometimes();
}

static class HystrixClientFallback implements HystrixClient {
    @Override
    public Hello iFailSometimes() {
        return new Hello("fallback");
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>If one needs access to the cause that made the fallback trigger, one can use the <literal>fallbackFactory</literal> attribute inside <literal>@FeignClient</literal>.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@FeignClient(name = "hello", fallbackFactory = HystrixClientFallbackFactory.class)
protected interface HystrixClient {
	@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value = "/hello")
	Hello iFailSometimes();
}

@Component
static class HystrixClientFallbackFactory implements FallbackFactory&lt;HystrixClient&gt; {
	@Override
	public HystrixClient create(Throwable cause) {
		return new HystrixClient() {
			@Override
			public Hello iFailSometimes() {
				return new Hello("fallback; reason was: " + cause.getMessage());
			}
		};
	}
}</programlisting>
<warning>
<simpara>There is a limitation with the implementation of fallbacks in Feign and how Hystrix fallbacks work. Fallbacks are currently not supported for methods that return <literal>com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixCommand</literal> and <literal>rx.Observable</literal>.</simpara>
</warning>
</section>
<section xml:id="_feign_and_literal_primary_literal">
<title>Feign and <literal>@Primary</literal></title>
<simpara>When using Feign with Hystrix fallbacks, there are multiple beans in the <literal>ApplicationContext</literal> of the same type. This will cause <literal>@Autowired</literal> to not work because there isn&#8217;t exactly one bean, or one marked as primary. To work around this, Spring Cloud Netflix marks all Feign instances as <literal>@Primary</literal>, so Spring Framework will know which bean to inject. In some cases, this may not be desirable. To turn off this behavior set the <literal>primary</literal> attribute of <literal>@FeignClient</literal> to false.</simpara>

stripped). The proxy uses Ribbon to locate an instance to forward to
via discovery, and all requests are executed in a
&lt;&lt;hystrix-fallbacks-for-routes, hystrix command&gt;&gt;, so
failures will show up in Hystrix metrics, and once the circuit is open
the proxy will not try to contact the service.</literallayout>

<chapter xml:id="_quick_start_2">
<title>Quick Start</title>
<simpara>You can try Spring Cloud Stream in less then 5 min even before you jump into any details and the following <emphasis>three-step guide</emphasis> will help.</simpara>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll create a simple Spring Cloud Stream application which receives messages coming from the messaging middleware of your choice (more on this later) and
logs received messages to the console. We&#8217;ll call it <emphasis>LoggingConsumer</emphasis>. While not very practical it will certainly provide a good introduction to some of the main concepts
and abstractions, making it easier to digest the rest of this user guide.</simpara>
<simpara>So let&#8217;s get started. . .</simpara>
<section xml:id="_step_one_create_sample_application_using_spring_initilaizer">
<title>Step One - Create sample Application using Spring Initilaizer</title>
<simpara>Visit the <link xl:href="https://start.spring.io">Spring Initializr</link>. This is where we&#8217;ll generate our <emphasis>LoggingConsumer</emphasis> application.</simpara>
<simpara>In the <emphasis>Dependencies</emphasis> start typing 'stream' and <emphasis>Cloud Stream</emphasis> option should pop up. Select it. Now start typing either 'kafka' or 'rabbit'. Basically this is where you are choosing
what messaging midleware this application will be bound to. Choose the one you have already installed and/or feel more comfortable with installing/running.
Also, as you can see from the Initilaizer screen there are few other options you can choose. For example, you can choose Gradle as your build tool instead of the default Maven.
With the <emphasis>Dependencies</emphasis> selected the only other thing you have to identify is the application name - <emphasis>logging-consumer</emphasis>.
Your configuration screeen should now contain the following:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">Dependencies: Cloud Stream, RabbitMQ (or Kafka)
Group: com.example - default
Artifact: logging-consumer
Spring Boot Version: 2.0.0 (or above) - default</literallayout>
<simpara>Click on <emphasis>Generate Project</emphasis> button. This will donwload the zipped version of the generated project to your hard drive. Unzip it and you&#8217;re ready for Step Two.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_step_two_import_project_into_the_ide">
<title>Step Two - Import project into the IDE</title>
<simpara>Here you simply import the project into your IDE of choice.
Please keep in mind that dependening on the IDE you may need to follow a specific import procedures. For example depending on how the project was generated (Maven or Gradle)
you may need to follow specific import procedure (e.g., in Eclipse/STS: <literal>File &#8594; Import &#8594; Maven &#8594; Existing Maven Project</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>Ones imported the project must have no errors of any kind and <literal>src/main/java</literal> should also contain <literal>com.example.loggingconsumer.LoggingConsumerApplication</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Technically at this point you can just run the application&#8217;s main class since it&#8217;s already a valid <emphasis>Spring Boot</emphasis> application, but it does not do anything, so let&#8217;s add some code.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_step_three_add_message_handler_build_and_run">
<title>Step Three - Add message handler, build and run</title>
<simpara>Modify the <literal>com.example.loggingconsumer.LoggingConsumerApplication</literal> to look as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public class LoggingConsumerApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(LoggingConsumerApplication.class, args);
	}

	@StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)
	public void handle(Person person) {
		System.out.println("Received: " + person);
	}

	public static class Person {
		private String name;
		public String getName() {
			return name;
		}
		public void setName(String name) {
			this.name = name;
		}
		public String toString() {
			return this.name;
		}
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>As you can see from the above:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>We&#8217;ve enabled <literal>Sink</literal> binding (input-no-output) via <literal>@EnableBinding(Sink.class)</literal>. This will signal to the framework to initiate binding to the messaging middleware where
it will auto-create the destination (i.e., queue, topic) which will be bound to <literal>Sink.INPUT</literal> channel.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>We&#8217;ve added handler method to receive incoming Message as type <literal>Person</literal>. What this means is that here youcan already observe one of the core features of the framework where
it will attempt to automatically convert incoming message&#8217;s payload to type <literal>Person</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>This is it, we now have a fully functional Spring Cloud Stream application that does something. From here for simplicity we&#8217;ll assume RabbitMQ was selected in <emphasis>step one</emphasis>.
Assuming you have RabbitMQ installed and running, start the application by simply running its <literal>main</literal> method.</simpara>
<simpara>You should see following output:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">--- [ main] c.s.b.r.p.RabbitExchangeQueueProvisioner : declaring queue for inbound: input.anonymous.CbMIwdkJSBO1ZoPDOtHtCg, bound to: input

. . .
--- [ main] c.e.l.LoggingConsumerApplication         : Started LoggingConsumerApplication in 2.531 seconds (JVM running for 2.897)</literallayout>
<simpara>Go to RabbitMQ management console or any other RabbitMQ client and simply send message to <literal>input.anonymous.CbMIwdkJSBO1ZoPDOtHtCg</literal>
(NOTE: the <literal>anonymous.CbMIwdkJSBO1ZoPDOtHtCg</literal> part represents the group name and is generated and will be different in your environment. For something more
predictable you can use explicit group name via <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.group=hello</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>The contents of the message should be JSON representation of <literal>Person</literal> class, so let&#8217;s send this:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">{"name":"Turd Ferguson"}</literallayout>
<simpara>And in your console you should see:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">Received: Turd Ferguson</literallayout>
<simpara>You can also build/package your application into a boot jar (i.e., <literal>./mvnw clean install</literal>) and run the built JAR using <literal>java -jar</literal> command.</simpara>
<simpara>That is all!</simpara>

</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_introducing_spring_cloud_stream">
<title>Introducing Spring Cloud Stream</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building message-driven microservice applications.
Spring Cloud Stream builds upon Spring Boot to create standalone, production-grade Spring applications, and uses Spring Integration to provide connectivity to message brokers.
It provides opinionated configuration of middleware from several vendors, introducing the concepts of persistent publish-subscribe semantics, consumer groups, and partitions.</simpara>
<simpara>You can add the <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> annotation to your application to get immediate connectivity to a message broker, and you can add <literal>@StreamListener</literal> to a method to cause it to receive events for stream processing.
The following is a simple sink application which receives external messages.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public class VoteRecordingSinkApplication {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(VoteRecordingSinkApplication.class, args);
  }

  @StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)
  public void processVote(Vote vote) {
      votingService.recordVote(vote);
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> annotation takes one or more interfaces as parameters (in this case, the parameter is a single <literal>Sink</literal> interface).
An interface declares input and/or output channels.
Spring Cloud Stream provides the interfaces <literal>Source</literal>, <literal>Sink</literal>, and <literal>Processor</literal>; you can also define your own interfaces.</simpara>
<simpara>The following is the definition of the <literal>Sink</literal> interface:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface Sink {
  String INPUT = "input";

  @Input(Sink.INPUT)
  SubscribableChannel input();
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>@Input</literal> annotation identifies an <emphasis>input channel</emphasis>, through which received messages enter the application; the <literal>@Output</literal> annotation identifies an <emphasis>output channel</emphasis>, through which published messages leave the application.
The <literal>@Input</literal> and <literal>@Output</literal> annotations can take a channel name as a parameter; if a name is not provided, the name of the annotated method will be used.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream will create an implementation of the interface for you.
You can use this in the application by autowiring it, as in the following example of a test case.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@SpringApplicationConfiguration(classes = VoteRecordingSinkApplication.class)
@WebAppConfiguration
@DirtiesContext
public class StreamApplicationTests {

  @Autowired
  private Sink sink;

  @Test
  public void contextLoads() {
    assertNotNull(this.sink.input());
  }
}</programlisting>

<section xml:id="_the_binder_abstraction">
<title>The Binder Abstraction</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides Binder implementations for <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/tree/master/spring-cloud-stream-binders/spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka">Kafka</link> and <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/tree/master/spring-cloud-stream-binders/spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit">Rabbit MQ</link>.
Spring Cloud Stream also includes a <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/blob/master/spring-cloud-stream-test-support/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/stream/test/binder/TestSupportBinder.java">TestSupportBinder</link>, which leaves a channel unmodified so that tests can interact with channels directly and reliably assert on what is received.
You can use the extensible API to write your own Binder.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream uses Spring Boot for configuration, and the Binder abstraction makes it possible for a Spring Cloud Stream application to be flexible in how it connects to middleware.
For example, deployers can dynamically choose, at runtime, the destinations (e.g., the Kafka topics or RabbitMQ exchanges) to which channels connect.
Such configuration can be provided through external configuration properties and in any form supported by Spring Boot (including application arguments, environment variables, and <literal>application.yml</literal> or <literal>application.properties</literal> files).
In the sink example from the <xref linkend="_introducing_spring_cloud_stream"/> section, setting the application property <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination</literal> to <literal>raw-sensor-data</literal> will cause it to read from the <literal>raw-sensor-data</literal> Kafka topic, or from a queue bound to the <literal>raw-sensor-data</literal> RabbitMQ exchange.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream automatically detects and uses a binder found on the classpath.
You can easily use different types of middleware with the same code: just include a different binder at build time.
For more complex use cases, you can also package multiple binders with your application and have it choose the binder, and even whether to use different binders for different channels, at runtime.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_persistent_publish_subscribe_support">
<title>Persistent Publish-Subscribe Support</title>
<simpara>Communication between applications follows a publish-subscribe model, where data is broadcast through shared topics.
This can be seen in the following figure, which shows a typical deployment for a set of interacting Spring Cloud Stream applications.</simpara>
<figure>
<title>Spring Cloud Stream Publish-Subscribe</title>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/SCSt-sensors.png" contentwidth="300" width="50%" scalefit="1"/>
</imageobject>
<textobject><phrase>SCSt sensors</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>Data reported by sensors to an HTTP endpoint is sent to a common destination named <literal>raw-sensor-data</literal>.
From the destination, it is independently processed by a microservice application that computes time-windowed averages and by another microservice application that ingests the raw data into HDFS.
In order to process the data, both applications declare the topic as their input at runtime.</simpara>
<simpara>The publish-subscribe communication model reduces the complexity of both the producer and the consumer, and allows new applications to be added to the topology without disruption of the existing flow.
For example, downstream from the average-calculating application, you can add an application that calculates the highest temperature values for display and monitoring.
You can then add another application that interprets the same flow of averages for fault detection.
Doing all communication through shared topics rather than point-to-point queues reduces coupling between microservices.</simpara>
<simpara>While the concept of publish-subscribe messaging is not new, Spring Cloud Stream takes the extra step of making it an opinionated choice for its application model.
By using native middleware support, Spring Cloud Stream also simplifies use of the publish-subscribe model across different platforms.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="consumer-groups">
<title>Consumer Groups</title>
<simpara>While the publish-subscribe model makes it easy to connect applications through shared topics, the ability to scale up by creating multiple instances of a given application is equally important.
When doing this, different instances of an application are placed in a competing consumer relationship, where only one of the instances is expected to handle a given message.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream models this behavior through the concept of a <emphasis>consumer group</emphasis>.
(Spring Cloud Stream consumer groups are similar to and inspired by Kafka consumer groups.)
Each consumer binding can use the <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.&lt;channelName&gt;.group</literal> property to specify a group name.
For the consumers shown in the following figure, this property would be set as <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.&lt;channelName&gt;.group=hdfsWrite</literal> or <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.&lt;channelName&gt;.group=average</literal>.</simpara>
<figure>

</imageobject>
<textobject><phrase>SCSt groups</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>All groups which subscribe to a given destination receive a copy of published data, but only one member of each group receives a given message from that destination.
By default, when a group is not specified, Spring Cloud Stream assigns the application to an anonymous and independent single-member consumer group that is in a publish-subscribe relationship with all other consumer groups.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="consumer-types">
<title>Consumer Types</title>
<simpara>Two types of consumer are supported:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Message-driven (sometimes referred to as Asynchronous)</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Polled (sometimes referred to as Synchronous)</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Prior to <emphasis>version 2.0</emphasis>, only asynchronous consumers were supported, where a message is delivered as soon as it is available (and there is a thread available to process it).</simpara>
<simpara>You might want to use a synchronous consumer when you wish to control the rate at which messages are processed.</simpara>
<section xml:id="durability">
<title>Durability</title>
<simpara>Consistent with the opinionated application model of Spring Cloud Stream, consumer group subscriptions are <emphasis>durable</emphasis>.
That is, a binder implementation ensures that group subscriptions are persistent, and ones at least one subscription for a group has been created, the group will receive messages, even if they are sent while all applications in the group are stopped.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Anonymous subscriptions are non-durable by nature.
For some binder implementations (e.g., RabbitMQ), it is possible to have non-durable group subscriptions.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>In general, it is preferable to always specify a consumer group when binding an application to a given destination.
When scaling up a Spring Cloud Stream application, you must specify a consumer group for each of its input bindings.
This prevents the application&#8217;s instances from receiving duplicate messages (unless that behavior is desired, which is unusual).</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="partitioning">
<title>Partitioning Support</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides support for <emphasis>partitioning</emphasis> data between multiple instances of a given application.
In a partitioned scenario, the physical communication medium (e.g., the broker topic) is viewed as being structured into multiple partitions.
One or more producer application instances send data to multiple consumer application instances and ensure that data identified by common characteristics are processed by the same consumer instance.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides a common abstraction for implementing partitioned processing use cases in a uniform fashion.
Partitioning can thus be used whether the broker itself is naturally partitioned (e.g., Kafka) or not (e.g., RabbitMQ).</simpara>
<figure>

</imageobject>
<textobject><phrase>SCSt partitioning</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>Partitioning is a critical concept in stateful processing, where it is critical, for either performance or consistency reasons, to ensure that all related data is processed together.
For example, in the time-windowed average calculation example, it is important that all measurements from any given sensor are processed by the same application instance.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>To set up a partitioned processing scenario, you must configure both the data-producing and the data-consuming ends.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_programming_model">
<title>Programming Model</title>
<simpara>This section describes Spring Cloud Stream&#8217;s programming model.
Spring Cloud Stream provides a number of predefined annotations for declaring bound input and output channels as well as how to listen to channels.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_declaring_and_binding_producers_and_consumers">
<title>Declaring and Binding Producers and Consumers</title>
<section xml:id="_triggering_binding_via_literal_enablebinding_literal">
<title>Triggering Binding Via <literal>@EnableBinding</literal></title>
<simpara>You can turn a Spring application into a Spring Cloud Stream application by applying the <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> annotation to one of the application&#8217;s configuration classes.
The <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> annotation itself is meta-annotated with <literal>@Configuration</literal> and triggers the configuration of Spring Cloud Stream infrastructure:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">...
@Import(...)
@Configuration
@EnableIntegration
public @interface EnableBinding {
    ...
    Class&lt;?&gt;[] value() default {};
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> annotation can take as parameters one or more interface classes that contain methods which represent bindable components (typically message channels).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> annotation is only required on your <literal>Configuration</literal> classes, you can provide as many binding interfaces as you need, for instance: <literal>@EnableBinding(value={Orders.class, Payment.class}</literal>.
Where both <literal>Order</literal> and <literal>Payment</literal> interfaces would declare <literal>@Input</literal> and <literal>@Output</literal> channels.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="__literal_input_literal_and_literal_output_literal">
<title><literal>@Input</literal> and <literal>@Output</literal></title>
<simpara>A Spring Cloud Stream application can have an arbitrary number of input and output channels defined in an interface as <literal>@Input</literal> and <literal>@Output</literal> methods:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface Barista {

    @Input
    SubscribableChannel orders();

    @Output
    MessageChannel hotDrinks();

    @Output
    MessageChannel coldDrinks();
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Using this interface as a parameter to <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> will trigger the creation of three bound channels named <literal>orders</literal>, <literal>hotDrinks</literal>, and <literal>coldDrinks</literal>, respectively.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Barista.class)
public class CafeConfiguration {

   ...
}</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>In Spring Cloud Stream, the bindable <literal>MessageChannel</literal> components are the Spring Messaging <literal>MessageChannel</literal> (for outbound) and its extension <literal>SubscribableChannel</literal> (for inbound).
Using the same mechanism, other bindable components can be supported.
<literal>KStream</literal> support in Spring Cloud Stream Kafka binder is one such example where KStream is used as inbound/outbound <literal>bindable</literal> components.
Also, as discussed below, a <literal>PollableMessageSource</literal> can be bound to an inbound destination.
In this documentation, we will continue to refer to MessageChannels as the <literal>bindable</literal> components.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Starting with <emphasis>version 2.0</emphasis>, you can now bind a pollable consumer as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface PolledBarista {

    @Input
    PollableMessageSource orders();

    @Output
    MessageChannel hotDrinks();

    @Output
    MessageChannel coldDrinks();
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In this case, an implementation of <literal>PollableMessageSource</literal> is bound to the <literal>orders</literal> "channel".</simpara>
<section xml:id="_customizing_channel_names">
<title>Customizing Channel Names</title>
<simpara>Using the <literal>@Input</literal> and <literal>@Output</literal> annotations, you can specify a customized channel name for the channel, as shown in the following example:</simpara>

<title>Accessing Bound Channels</title>
<section xml:id="_injecting_the_bound_interfaces">
<title>Injecting the Bound Interfaces</title>
<simpara>For each bound interface, Spring Cloud Stream will generate a bean that implements the interface.
Invoking a <literal>@Input</literal>-annotated or <literal>@Output</literal>-annotated method of one of these beans will return the relevant bound channel.</simpara>
<simpara>The bean in the following example sends a message on the output channel when its <literal>hello</literal> method is invoked.
It invokes <literal>output()</literal> on the injected <literal>Source</literal> bean to retrieve the target channel.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Component

    }
}</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_injecting_channels_directly">

<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface CustomSource {
    ...
    @Output("customOutput")
    MessageChannel output();
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The channel will be injected as shown in the following example:</simpara>

<section xml:id="_producing_and_consuming_messages">
<title>Producing and Consuming Messages</title>
<simpara>You can write a Spring Cloud Stream application using either Spring Integration annotations or Spring Cloud Stream&#8217;s <literal>@StreamListener</literal> annotation.
The <literal>@StreamListener</literal> annotation is modeled after other Spring Messaging annotations (such as <literal>@MessageMapping</literal>, <literal>@JmsListener</literal>, <literal>@RabbitListener</literal>, etc.) but adds content type management and type coercion features.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_native_spring_integration_support">
<title>Native Spring Integration Support</title>
<simpara>Because Spring Cloud Stream is based on Spring Integration, Stream completely inherits Integration&#8217;s foundation and infrastructure as well as the component itself.
For example, you can attach the  output channel of a <literal>Source</literal> to a <literal>MessageSource</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Source.class)
public class TimerSource {

  @Value("${format}")

  public MessageSource&lt;String&gt; timerMessageSource() {
    return () -&gt; new GenericMessage&lt;&gt;(new SimpleDateFormat(format).format(new Date()));
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Or you can use a processor&#8217;s channels in a transformer:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
public class TransformProcessor {

<note>
<simpara>It&#8217;s important to understant that when you consume from the same binding using <literal>@StreamListener</literal> a pubsub model is used, where each method annotated with <literal>@StreamListener</literal> receives it&#8217;s own copy of the message, each one has its own consumer group.
However, if you share a bindable channel as an input for <literal>@Aggregator</literal>, <literal>@Transformer</literal> or <literal>@ServiceActivator</literal>, those will consume in a competing model, no individual consumer group is created for each subscription.</simpara>

</section>
<section xml:id="_spring_integration_error_channel_support">
<title>Spring Integration Error Channel Support</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream supports publishing error messages received by the Spring Integration global
error channel. Error messages sent to the <literal>errorChannel</literal> can be published to a specific destination
at the broker by configuring a binding for the outbound target named <literal>error</literal>. For example, to
publish error messages to a broker destination named "myErrors", provide the following property:
<literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.error.destination=myErrors</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="binder-error-channels">
<title>Message Channel Binders and Error Channels</title>
<simpara>Starting with <emphasis>version 1.3</emphasis>, some <literal>MessageChannel</literal> - based binders publish errors to a discrete error channel for each destination.
In addition, these error channels are bridged to the global Spring Integration <literal>errorChannel</literal> mentioned above.
You can therefore consume errors for specific destinations and/or for all destinations, using a standard Spring Integration flow (<literal>IntegrationFlow</literal>, <literal>@ServiceActivator</literal>, etc.).</simpara>
<simpara>On the consumer side, the listener thread catches any exceptions and forwards an <literal>ErrorMessage</literal> to the destination&#8217;s error channel.
The payload of the message is a <literal>MessagingException</literal> with the normal <literal>failedMessage</literal> and <literal>cause</literal> properties.
Usually, the raw data received from the broker is included in a header.
For binders that support (and are configured with) a dead letter destination; a <literal>MessagePublishingErrorHandler</literal> is subscribed to the channel, and the raw data is forwarded to the dead letter destination.</simpara>
<simpara>On the producer side; for binders that support some kind of async result after publishing messages (e.g. RabbitMQ, Kafka), you can enable an error channel by setting the <literal>&#8230;&#8203;producer.errorChannelEnabled</literal> to <literal>true</literal>.
The payload of the <literal>ErrorMessage</literal> depends on the binder implementation but will be a <literal>MessagingException</literal> with the normal <literal>failedMessage</literal>  property, as well as additional properties about the failure.
Refer to the binder documentation for complete details.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_using_streamlistener_for_automatic_content_type_handling">
<title>Using @StreamListener for Automatic Content Type Handling</title>
<simpara>Complementary to its Spring Integration support, Spring Cloud Stream provides its own <literal>@StreamListener</literal> annotation, modeled after other Spring Messaging annotations (e.g. <literal>@MessageMapping</literal>, <literal>@JmsListener</literal>, <literal>@RabbitListener</literal>, etc.).
The <literal>@StreamListener</literal> annotation provides a simpler model for handling inbound messages, especially when dealing with use cases that involve content type management and type coercion.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides an extensible <literal>MessageConverter</literal> mechanism for handling data conversion by bound channels and for, in this case, dispatching to methods annotated with <literal>@StreamListener</literal>.
The following is an example of an application which processes external <literal>Vote</literal> events:</simpara>

<simpara>The distinction between <literal>@StreamListener</literal> and a Spring Integration <literal>@ServiceActivator</literal> is seen when considering an inbound <literal>Message</literal> that has a <literal>String</literal> payload and a <literal>contentType</literal> header of <literal>application/json</literal>.
In the case of <literal>@StreamListener</literal>, the <literal>MessageConverter</literal> mechanism will use the <literal>contentType</literal> header to parse the <literal>String</literal> payload into a <literal>Vote</literal> object.</simpara>
<simpara>As with other Spring Messaging methods, method arguments can be annotated with <literal>@Payload</literal>, <literal>@Headers</literal> and <literal>@Header</literal>.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_using_streamlistener_for_dispatching_messages_to_multiple_methods">
<title>Using @StreamListener for dispatching messages to multiple methods</title>
<simpara>Since version 1.2, Spring Cloud Stream supports dispatching messages to multiple <literal>@StreamListener</literal> methods registered on an input channel, based on a condition.</simpara>
<simpara>In order to be eligible to support conditional dispatching, a method must satisfy the follow conditions:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>it must not return a value</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>it must be an individual message handling method (reactive API methods are not supported)</simpara>

</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The condition is specified via a SpEL expression in the <literal>condition</literal> attribute of the annotation and is evaluated for each message.
All the handlers that match the condition will be invoked in the same thread and no assumption must be made about the order in which the invocations take place.</simpara>
<simpara>An example of using <literal>@StreamListener</literal> with dispatching conditions can be seen below.
In this example, all the messages bearing a header <literal>type</literal> with the value <literal>foo</literal> will be dispatched to the <literal>receiveFoo</literal> method, and all the messages bearing a header <literal>type</literal> with the value <literal>bar</literal> will be dispatched to the <literal>receiveBar</literal> method.</simpara>

<simpara>&#8230;&#8203;you might use that consumer as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public ApplicationRunner poller(PollableMessageSource destIn, MessageChannel destOut) {
    return args -&gt; {
        while (someCondition()) {
            try {
                if (!destIn.poll(m -&gt; {

<simpara>The <literal>PollableMessageSource.poll()</literal> method takes a <literal>MessageHandler</literal> argument (often a lambda expression as shown here).
It returns <literal>true</literal> if the message was received and successfully processed.</simpara>
<simpara>As with message-driven consumers, if the <literal>MessageHandler</literal> throws an exception, messages are published to error channels as discussed in <xref linkend="binder-error-channels"/>.</simpara>
<simpara>Normally, the <literal>poll()</literal> method will acknowledge the message when the <literal>MessageHandler</literal> exits.
If the method exits abnormally, the message is rejected (not requeued).
You can override that behavior, by taking responsibility for the acknowledgment, as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public ApplicationRunner poller(PollableMessageSource dest1In, MessageChannel dest2Out) {
    return args -&gt; {
        while (someCondition()) {
            if (!dest1In.poll(m -&gt; {
                StaticMessageHeaderAccessor.getAcknowledgmentCallback(m).noAutoAck();
                // e.g. hand off to another thread which can perform the ack
                // or acknowledge(Status.REQUEUE)

            })) {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            }
        }
    };
}</programlisting>
<important>
<simpara>You must ack (or nack) the message at some point, to avoid resource leaks.</simpara>
</important>
<important>
<simpara>Some messaging systems (such as Apache Kafka) maintain a simple offset in a log, if a delivery fails and is requeued with  <literal>StaticMessageHeaderAccessor.getAcknowledgmentCallback(m).acknowledge(Status.REQUEUE);</literal>, any later successfully ack&#8217;d messages will be redelivered.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>There is also an overloaded <literal>poll</literal> method:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">poll(MessageHandler handler, ParameterizedTypeReference&lt;?&gt; type)</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>type</literal> is a conversion hint allowing the incoming message payload to be converted:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">boolean result = pollableSource.poll(received -&gt; {

<title>Reactive Programming Support</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream also supports the use of reactive APIs where incoming and outgoing data is handled as continuous data flows.
Support for reactive APIs is available via the <literal>spring-cloud-stream-reactive</literal>, which needs to be added explicitly to your project.</simpara>
<simpara>The programming model with reactive APIs is declarative, where instead of specifying how each individual message should be handled, you can use operators that describe functional transformations from inbound to outbound data flows.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream supports the following reactive APIs:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Reactor</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>In the future, it is intended to support a more generic model based on Reactive Streams.</simpara>
<simpara>The reactive programming model is also using the <literal>@StreamListener</literal> annotation for setting up reactive handlers. The differences are that:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>the <literal>@StreamListener</literal> annotation must not specify an input or output, as they are provided as arguments and return values from the method;</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>the arguments of the method must be annotated with <literal>@Input</literal> and <literal>@Output</literal> indicating which input or output will the incoming and respectively outgoing data flows connect to;</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>the return value of the method, if any, will be annotated with <literal>@Output</literal>, indicating the input where data shall be sent.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<note>
<simpara>Reactive programming support requires Java 1.8.</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>As of Spring Cloud Stream 1.1.1 and later (starting with release train Brooklyn.SR2), reactive programming support requires the use of Reactor 3.0.4.RELEASE and higher.
Earlier Reactor versions (including 3.0.1.RELEASE, 3.0.2.RELEASE and 3.0.3.RELEASE) are not supported.
<literal>spring-cloud-stream-reactive</literal> will transitively retrieve the proper version, but it is possible for the project structure to manage the version of the <literal>io.projectreactor:reactor-core</literal> to an earlier release, especially when using Maven.
This is the case for projects generated via Spring Initializr with Spring Boot 1.x, which will override the Reactor version to <literal>2.0.8.RELEASE</literal>.
In such cases you must ensure that the proper version of the artifact is released.
This can be simply achieved by adding a direct dependency on <literal>io.projectreactor:reactor-core</literal> with a version of <literal>3.0.4.RELEASE</literal> or later to your project.</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>The use of term <literal>reactive</literal> is currently referring to the reactive APIs being used and not to the execution model being reactive (i.e. the bound endpoints are still using a 'push' rather than 'pull' model). While some backpressure support is provided by the use of Reactor, we do intend on the long run to support entirely reactive pipelines by the use of native reactive clients for the connected middleware.</simpara>
</note>
<section xml:id="_reactor_based_handlers">
<title>Reactor-based handlers</title>
<simpara>A Reactor based handler can have the following argument types:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>For arguments annotated with <literal>@Input</literal>, it supports the  Reactor type <literal>Flux</literal>.
The parameterization of the inbound Flux follows the same rules as in the case of individual message handling: it can be the entire <literal>Message</literal>, a POJO which can be the <literal>Message</literal> payload, or a POJO which is the result of a transformation based on the <literal>Message</literal> content-type header. Multiple inputs are provided;</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>For arguments annotated with <literal>Output</literal>, it supports the type <literal>FluxSender</literal> which connects a <literal>Flux</literal> produced by the method with an output. Generally speaking, specifying outputs as arguments is only recommended when the method can have multiple outputs;</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>A Reactor based handler supports a return type of <literal>Flux</literal>, case in which it must be annotated with <literal>@Output</literal>. We recommend using the return value of the method when a single output flux is available.</simpara>
<simpara>Here is an example of a simple Reactor-based Processor.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class UppercaseTransformer {

  @StreamListener
  @Output(Processor.OUTPUT)
  public Flux&lt;String&gt; receive(@Input(Processor.INPUT) Flux&lt;String&gt; input) {
    return input.map(s -&gt; s.toUpperCase());
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The same processor using output arguments looks like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class UppercaseTransformer {

  @StreamListener
  public void receive(@Input(Processor.INPUT) Flux&lt;String&gt; input,
     @Output(Processor.OUTPUT) FluxSender output) {
     output.send(input.map(s -&gt; s.toUpperCase()));
  }
}</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_reactive_sources">
<title>Reactive Sources</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream reactive support also provides the ability for creating reactive sources through the StreamEmitter annotation.
Using StreamEmitter annotation, a regular source may be converted to a reactive one.
StreamEmitter is a method level annotation that marks a method to be an emitter to outputs declared via EnableBinding.
It is not allowed to use the Input annotation along with StreamEmitter, as the methods marked with this annotation are not listening from any input, rather generating to an output.
Following the same programming model used in StreamListener, StreamEmitter also allows flexible ways of using the Output annotation depending on whether the method has any arguments, return type etc.</simpara>
<simpara>Here are some examples of using StreamEmitter in various styles.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example will emit the "Hello World" message every millisecond and publish to a Flux.
In this case, the resulting messages in Flux will be sent to the output channel of the Source.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Source.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class HelloWorldEmitter {

  @StreamEmitter
  @Output(Source.OUTPUT)
  public Flux&lt;String&gt; emit() {
    return Flux.intervalMillis(1)
            .map(l -&gt; "Hello World");
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Following is another flavor of the same sample as above.
Instead of returning a Flux, this method uses a FluxSender to programmatically send Flux from a source.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Source.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class HelloWorldEmitter {

  @StreamEmitter
  @Output(Source.OUTPUT)
  public void emit(FluxSender output) {
    output.send(Flux.intervalMillis(1)
            .map(l -&gt; "Hello World"));
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Following is exactly same as the above snippet in functionality and style.
However, instead of using an explicit Output annotation at the method level, it is used as the method parameter level.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Source.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class HelloWorldEmitter {

  @StreamEmitter
  public void emit(@Output(Source.OUTPUT) FluxSender output) {
    output.send(Flux.intervalMillis(1)
            .map(l -&gt; "Hello World"));
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Here is yet another flavor of writing reacting sources using the Reactive Streams Publisher API and the support for it in the <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration-java-dsl/wiki/Spring-Integration-Java-DSL-Reference">Spring Integration Java DSL</link>.
The Publisher is still using Reactor Flux under the hood, but from an application perspective, that is transparent to the user and only needs Reactive Streams and Java DSL for Spring Integration.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Source.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class HelloWorldEmitter {

  @StreamEmitter
  @Output(Source.OUTPUT)
  @Bean
  public Publisher&lt;Message&lt;String&gt;&gt; emit() {
    return IntegrationFlows.from(() -&gt;
                new GenericMessage&lt;&gt;("Hello World"),

        .toReactivePublisher();

<section xml:id="_aggregation">
<title>Aggregation</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides support for aggregating multiple applications together, connecting their input and output channels directly and avoiding the additional cost of exchanging messages via a broker.
As of version 1.0 of Spring Cloud Stream, aggregation is supported only for the following types of applications:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis>sources</emphasis> - applications with a single output channel named <literal>output</literal>, typically having a single binding of the type <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.messaging.Source</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis>sinks</emphasis> - applications with a single input channel named <literal>input</literal>, typically having a single binding of the type <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.messaging.Sink</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis>processors</emphasis> - applications with a single input channel named <literal>input</literal> and a single output channel named <literal>output</literal>, typically having a single binding of the type <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.messaging.Processor</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>They can be aggregated together by creating a sequence of interconnected applications, in which the output channel of an element in the sequence is connected to the input channel of the next element, if it exists.
A sequence can start with either a <emphasis>source</emphasis> or a <emphasis>processor</emphasis>, it can contain an arbitrary number of <emphasis>processors</emphasis> and must end with either a <emphasis>processor</emphasis> or a <emphasis>sink</emphasis>.</simpara>
<simpara>Depending on the nature of the starting and ending element, the sequence may have one or more bindable channels, as follows:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>if the sequence starts with a source and ends with a sink, all communication between the applications is direct and no channels will be bound</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>if the sequence starts with a processor, then its input channel will become the <literal>input</literal> channel of the aggregate and will be bound accordingly</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>if the sequence ends with a processor, then its output channel will become the <literal>output</literal> channel of the aggregate and will be bound accordingly</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Aggregation is performed using the <literal>AggregateApplicationBuilder</literal> utility class, as in the following example.
Let&#8217;s consider a project in which we have source, processor and a sink, which may be defined in the project, or may be contained in one of the project&#8217;s dependencies.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Each component (source, sink or processor) in an aggregate application must be provided in a separate package if the configuration classes use <literal>@SpringBootApplication</literal>.
This is required to avoid cross-talk between applications, due to the classpath scanning performed by <literal>@SpringBootApplication</literal> on the configuration classes inside the same package.
In the example below, it can be seen that the Source, Processor and Sink application classes are grouped in separate packages.
A possible alternative is to provide the source, sink or processor configuration in a separate <literal>@Configuration</literal> class, avoid the use of <literal>@SpringBootApplication</literal>/<literal>@ComponentScan</literal> and use those for aggregation.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_configuring_binding_service_properties_for_non_self_contained_aggregate_application">
<title>Configuring binding service properties for non self contained aggregate application</title>

For example: a source application&#8217;s output and a processor application&#8217;s input are directly bound while the processor&#8217;s output channel is bound to an external destination at the broker.
When passing the binding service properties for non-self contained aggregate application, it is required to pass the binding service properties to the aggregate application instead of setting them as 'args' to individual child application.

<simpara>A <emphasis>producer</emphasis> is any component that sends messages to a channel.
The channel can be bound to an external message broker via a Binder implementation for that broker.
When invoking the <literal>bindProducer()</literal> method, the first parameter is the name of the destination within the broker, the second parameter is the local channel instance to which the producer will send messages, and the third parameter contains properties (such as a partition key expression) to be used within the adapter that is created for that channel.</simpara>
<simpara>A <emphasis>consumer</emphasis> is any component that receives messages from a channel.
As with a producer, the consumer&#8217;s channel can be bound to an external message broker.
When invoking the <literal>bindConsumer()</literal> method, the first parameter is the destination name, and a second parameter provides the name of a logical group of consumers.
Each group that is represented by consumer bindings for a given destination receives a copy of each message that a producer sends to that destination (i.e., publish-subscribe semantics).
If there are multiple consumer instances bound using the same group name, then messages will be load-balanced across those consumer instances so that each message sent by a producer is consumed by only a single consumer instance within each group (i.e., queueing semantics).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_binder_spi">
<title>Binder SPI</title>
<simpara>The Binder SPI consists of a number of interfaces, out-of-the box utility classes and discovery strategies that provide a pluggable mechanism for connecting to external middleware.</simpara>
<simpara>The key point of the SPI is the <literal>Binder</literal> interface which is a strategy for connecting inputs and outputs to external middleware.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface Binder&lt;T, C extends ConsumerProperties, P extends ProducerProperties&gt; {

<simpara>The interface is parameterized, offering a number of extension points:</simpara>

<title>Binder Detection</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream relies on implementations of the Binder SPI to perform the task of connecting channels to message brokers.
Each Binder implementation typically connects to one type of messaging system.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_classpath_detection">
<title>Classpath Detection</title>
<simpara>By default, Spring Cloud Stream relies on Spring Boot&#8217;s auto-configuration to configure the binding process.
If a single Binder implementation is found on the classpath, Spring Cloud Stream will use it automatically.
For example, a Spring Cloud Stream project that aims to bind only to RabbitMQ can simply add the following dependency:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit&lt;/artifactId&gt;

</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="multiple-binders">
<title>Multiple Binders on the Classpath</title>
<simpara>When multiple binders are present on the classpath, the application must indicate which binder is to be used for each channel binding.
Each binder configuration contains a <literal>META-INF/spring.binders</literal>, which is a simple properties file:</simpara>
<screen>rabbit:\
org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.rabbit.config.RabbitServiceAutoConfiguration</screen>
<simpara>Similar files exist for the other provided binder implementations (e.g., Kafka), and custom binder implementations are expected to provide them, as well.
The key represents an identifying name for the binder implementation, whereas the value is a comma-separated list of configuration classes that each contain one and only one bean definition of type <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.Binder</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Binder selection can either be performed globally, using the <literal>spring.cloud.stream.defaultBinder</literal> property (e.g., <literal>spring.cloud.stream.defaultBinder=rabbit</literal>) or individually, by configuring the binder on each channel binding.
For instance, a processor application (that has channels with the names <literal>input</literal> and <literal>output</literal> for read/write respectively) which reads from Kafka and writes to RabbitMQ can specify the following configuration:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.binder=kafka
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.binder=rabbit</screen>
</section>
<section xml:id="multiple-systems">
<title>Connecting to Multiple Systems</title>
<simpara>By default, binders share the application&#8217;s Spring Boot auto-configuration, so that one instance of each binder found on the classpath will be created.
If your application should connect to more than one broker of the same type, you can specify multiple binder configurations, each with different environment settings.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Turning on explicit binder configuration will disable the default binder configuration process altogether.
If you do this, all binders in use must be included in the configuration.
Frameworks that intend to use Spring Cloud Stream transparently may create binder configurations that can be referenced by name, but will not affect the default binder configuration.
In order to do so, a binder configuration may have its <literal>defaultCandidate</literal> flag set to false, e.g. <literal>spring.cloud.stream.binders.&lt;configurationName&gt;.defaultCandidate=false</literal>.
This denotes a configuration that will exist independently of the default binder configuration process.</simpara>

: Mapped "{[/actuator/bindings/{name}],methods=[GET]. . .</literallayout>
<simpara>To visualize current bindings simply access the following URL:</simpara>
<screen>http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/actuator/bindings</screen>
<simpara>or</simpara>
<screen>http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/actuator/bindings/myBindingName</screen>
<simpara>&#8230;&#8203;if you want to visualize a single binding named 'myBindingName'</simpara>
<simpara>You can also <emphasis>stop, start, pause</emphasis> and <emphasis>resume</emphasis> individual binding by posting to the same URL while providing <literal>state</literal> argument as JSON.</simpara>
<simpara>For example,</simpara>
<screen>curl -d '{"state":"STOPPED"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/actuator/bindings/myBindingName
curl -d '{"state":"STARTED"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/actuator/bindings/myBindingName
curl -d '{"state":"PAUSED"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/actuator/bindings/myBindingName
curl -d '{"state":"RESUMED"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/actuator/bindings/myBindingName</screen>
<note>
<simpara><emphasis>PAUSED</emphasis> and <emphasis>RESUMED</emphasis> are only effective if corresponding binder and its underlyig technology supports it, otherwise you&#8217;ll see the warning message in the logs.
Currently only Kafka binder supports <emphasis>PAUSED</emphasis> and <emphasis>RESUMED</emphasis> state.</simpara>

<title>Using dynamically bound destinations</title>
<simpara>Besides the channels defined via <literal>@EnableBinding</literal>, Spring Cloud Stream allows applications to send messages to dynamically bound destinations.
This is useful, for example, when the target destination needs to be determined at runtime.
Applications can do so by using the <literal>BinderAwareChannelResolver</literal> bean, registered automatically by the <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> annotation.</simpara>
<simpara>The property 'spring.cloud.stream.dynamicDestinations' can be used for restricting the dynamic destination names to a set known beforehand (whitelisting).
If the property is not set, any destination can be bound dynamically.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>BinderAwareChannelResolver</literal> can be used directly as in the following example, in which a REST controller uses a path variable to decide the target channel.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding
@Controller
public class SourceWithDynamicDestination {

    @Autowired
    private BinderAwareChannelResolver resolver;

    @RequestMapping(path = "/{target}", method = POST, consumes = "*/*")
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.ACCEPTED)
    public void handleRequest(@RequestBody String body, @PathVariable("target") target,
           @RequestHeader(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE) Object contentType) {
        sendMessage(body, target, contentType);
    }

    private void sendMessage(String body, String target, Object contentType) {
        resolver.resolveDestination(target).send(MessageBuilder.createMessage(body,
                new MessageHeaders(Collections.singletonMap(MessageHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE, contentType))));
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>After starting the application on the default port 8080, when sending the following data:</simpara>
<screen>curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d "customer-1" http://localhost:8080/customers

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d "order-1" http://localhost:8080/orders</screen>
<simpara>The destinations 'customers' and 'orders' are created in the broker (for example: exchange in case of Rabbit or topic in case of Kafka) with the names 'customers' and 'orders', and the data is published to the appropriate destinations.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>BinderAwareChannelResolver</literal> is a general purpose Spring Integration <literal>DestinationResolver</literal> and can be injected in other components.
For example, in a router using a SpEL expression based on the <literal>target</literal> field of an incoming JSON message.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding
@Controller
public class SourceWithDynamicDestination {

    @Autowired
    private BinderAwareChannelResolver resolver;


    @RequestMapping(path = "/", method = POST, consumes = "application/json")
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.ACCEPTED)
    public void handleRequest(@RequestBody String body, @RequestHeader(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE) Object contentType) {
        sendMessage(body, contentType);
    }

    private void sendMessage(Object body, Object contentType) {
        routerChannel().send(MessageBuilder.createMessage(body,
                new MessageHeaders(Collections.singletonMap(MessageHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE, contentType))));
    }

    @Bean(name = "routerChannel")
    public MessageChannel routerChannel() {
        return new DirectChannel();
    }

    @Bean
    @ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "routerChannel")
    public ExpressionEvaluatingRouter router() {
        ExpressionEvaluatingRouter router =
            new ExpressionEvaluatingRouter(new SpelExpressionParser().parseExpression("payload.target"));
        router.setDefaultOutputChannelName("default-output");
        router.setChannelResolver(resolver);
        return router;
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/router">Router Sink Application</link> uses this technique to create the destinations on-demand.</simpara>
<simpara>If the channel names are known in advance, you can configure the producer properties as with any other destination.
Alternatively, if you register a <literal>NewBindingCallback&lt;&gt;</literal> bean, it will be invoked just before the binding is created.
The callback takes the generic type of the extended producer properties used by the binder; it has one method:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">void configure(String channelName, MessageChannel channel, ProducerProperties producerProperties,
        T extendedProducerProperties);</programlisting>
<simpara>The following is an example using the RabbitMQ binder:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public NewBindingCallback&lt;RabbitProducerProperties&gt; dynamicConfigurer() {
    return (name, channel, props, extended) -&gt; {
        props.setRequiredGroups("bindThisQueue");
        extended.setQueueNameGroupOnly(true);
        extended.setAutoBindDlq(true);
        extended.setDeadLetterQueueName("myDLQ");
    };
}</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>If you need to support dynamic destinations with multiple binder types, use <literal>Object</literal> for the generic type and cast the <literal>extended</literal> argument as needed.</simpara>

<title>Content Type negotiation</title>
<section xml:id="_introduction">
<title>Introduction</title>
<simpara>Data transformation is one of the core features of any message-driven microservice architecture. Given that in Spring Cloud Stream, such data
is represented as a Spring <literal>Message</literal>, such message may have to be transformed to a desired shape/size before reaching its destination. This is required for two reasons:</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis>1. To convert the contents of the incoming message to match the signature of the application-provided handler.</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara><emphasis>2. To convert the contents of the outgoing message to the wire format.</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>The wire format is typically <literal>byte[]</literal> (i.e., Kafka and Rabbit binders), but is governed by the binder implementation.</simpara>
<simpara>In Spring Cloud Stream, message transformation is accomplished with a <literal>org.springframework.messaging.converter.MessageConverter</literal>.</simpara>

</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_mechanics">
<title>Mechanics</title>
<simpara>To better understand the mechanics and the necessity behind content-type negotiation let’s look at the very simple use case using the following message
handler as an example. Also let’s assume that this is the only handler in the application (no internal pipeline) for simplicity.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@StreamListener(Processor.INPUT)
@SendTo(Processor.OUTPUT)
public String handle(Person person) {..}</programlisting>
<simpara>The above handler expects <literal>Person</literal> type as an argument and will produce <literal>String</literal> type as an output. In order for the framework to succeed in passing the incoming
<literal>Message</literal> as an argument to this handler it has to somehow transform the payload of the <literal>Message</literal> from the wire format to <literal>Person</literal> type.
In other words the framework must locate and apply the appropriate <literal>MessageConverter</literal>. To accomplish that the framework needs some instructions
from the user. One of these instructions is already provided by the signature of the handler method itself (<literal>Person</literal> type), so in theory, that should and in some
cases is enough, but for the majority of the use cases in order to select the appropriate <literal>MessageConverter</literal> the framework needs an additional piece of information.
That missing piece is <literal>contentType</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides three simple mechanisms to define <literal>contentType</literal> and they all come with precedence order:</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis>1. <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis role="strong">HEADER</emphasis></emphasis> - the <literal>contentType</literal> can be communicated through the Message itself. By simply providing <literal>contentType</literal> header you are declaring the content type to use to locate and
apply the appropriate MessageConverter.</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara><emphasis>2. <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis role="strong">BINDING</emphasis></emphasis> - the <literal>contentType</literal> can be set per destination binding via <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.content-type</literal> property. NOTE: the segment <literal>input</literal> in the property name
corresponds to the actual name of the destination which is “input” in our case. This approach allows one to declare per-binding the content type to use to locate and
apply the appropriate MessageConverter.</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara><emphasis>3. <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis role="strong">DEFAULT</emphasis></emphasis> - in the event <literal>contentType</literal> is not present in the Message header and/or binding, the default <literal>application/json</literal> content type will be used to
locate and apply the appropriate MessageConverter.</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>As mentioned, the above also demonstrates the order of precedence in the event there is a tie. For example, header provided content type takes precedence over any other content type.
The same applies for content type set per binding which essentially allows one to override the default content type. But it also provides a sensible default which was determined from
the community feedback.</simpara>
<simpara>Another reason for making <literal>application/json</literal> the default stems from the interoperability requirements driven by distributed microservices architectures where producer and consumer not only
run in different JVMs, but can also run on different non-JVM platforms.</simpara>
<simpara>Once the non-void handler method returns and unless the return value is already a <literal>Message</literal>, the new <literal>Message</literal> is constructed with return vlaue as the payload while inheriting
headers from the input <literal>Message</literal> less the ones defined/filtered by <literal>SpringIntegrationProperties.messageHandlerNotPropagatedHeaders</literal>.
By default, there is only one header set there - <literal>contentType</literal>. This means that the new <literal>Message</literal> will not have <literal>contentType</literal> header set, thus ensuring that the <literal>contentType</literal>
can evolve. You can always opt out to returning a <literal>Message</literal> from the handler method where you can inject any header you wish.</simpara>
<simpara>If there is an internal pipeline the <literal>Message</literal> is sent to the next handler going through the same process of conversion, or if there is no internal
 pipeline or you’ve reached the end of it the <literal>Message</literal> is sent back to the output destination.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_content_type_vs_argument_type">
<title>Content type vs. argument type</title>
<simpara>As it was mentioned, for the framework to select the appropriate MessageConverter it requires <emphasis>argument type</emphasis> and optionally <emphasis>content type</emphasis> information.
The logic for selecting the appropriate <literal>MessageConverter</literal> resides with the argument resolvers (<literal>HandlerMethodArgumentResolvers</literal>), right before the invocation of the user
defined handler method (that is when the actual argument type is known to the framework).
If argument type does NOT match the type of the current payload the framework delegates to the stack of the
pre-configured <literal>MessageConverters</literal> to see if any one of them can convert the payload. As you can see the  <literal>Object fromMessage(Message&lt;?&gt; message, Class&lt;?&gt; targetClass);</literal>
operation of the MessageConverter takes <literal>targetClass</literal> as one of its arguments. The framework also ensures that the provided <literal>Message</literal> always contains <literal>contentType</literal> header
in the event one was not there already (injects the default one or the one set per binding).
That is the mechanism by which framework determines if message can be converted to a target type - <literal>contentType</literal> and argumenyt type.
If no appropriate <literal>MessageConverter</literal> is found the exception is thrown at which time you can add custom <literal>MessageConverter</literal> (more on this later).</simpara>
<simpara>But what if the payload type matches the target type declared by the handler method? In this cases there is obviously nothing to convert and the
payload will be passed unmodified. While this sounds pretty straight forward and logical, keep in mind handler methods that take <literal>Message&lt;?&gt;</literal> and/or <literal>Object</literal> as an
argument. By doing so you are essentially forfeiting the conversion process by declaring the target type to be <literal>Object</literal> which is an <literal>instanceof</literal> everything in Java.</simpara>
<simpara>In other words:</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Do NOT expect Message to be converted into some type based on the <literal>contentType</literal> only. Remember that the <literal>contentType</literal> is complimentary to the target type.
A hint if you wish which <literal>MessageConverter</literal> may or may not take into consideration.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_message_converters">
<title>Message Converters</title>
<simpara><literal>MessageConverters</literal> define two methods:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">Object fromMessage(Message&lt;?&gt; message, Class&lt;?&gt; targetClass);

Message&lt;?&gt; toMessage(Object payload, @Nullable MessageHeaders headers);</programlisting>
<simpara>It is important to understand the contract of these methods and their usage specifically in the context of Spring Cloud Stream.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>fromMessage</literal> method converts incoming <literal>Message</literal> to an argument type. The payload of the <literal>Message</literal> could be <emphasis>any type</emphasis> and it&#8217;s
up to the actual implementation of the <literal>MessageConverter</literal> to support multiple types. For example, some JSON converter may support the payload type as <literal>byte[]</literal>
and <literal>String</literal> etc. This is important when application contains an internal pipeline (i.e., <emphasis>input &#8594; handler1 &#8594; handler2 &#8594;. . . &#8594; output</emphasis>) and the output of
the upstream handler results in a <literal>Message</literal> which may not be in the initial wire format.</simpara>
<simpara>However. . .</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>toMessage</literal> method has a more strict contract and must always convert <literal>Message</literal> to the wire format - <literal>byte[]</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>So for all intents and purposes (and especially when implementing your own converter) you might as well look at them as:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">Object fromMessage(Message&lt;?&gt; message, Class&lt;?&gt; targetClass);

Message&lt;byte[]&gt; toMessage(Object payload, @Nullable MessageHeaders headers);</programlisting>

<simpara>The <literal>AvroSchemaMessageConverter</literal> supports serializing and deserializing messages either using a predefined schema or by using the schema information available in the class (either reflectively, or contained in the <literal>SpecificRecord</literal>).
If the target type of the conversion is a <literal>GenericRecord</literal>, then a schema must be set.</simpara>
<simpara>For using it, you can simply add it to the application context, optionally specifying one ore more <literal>MimeTypes</literal> to associate it with.

<simpara>Here is an example of configuring it in a sink application registering the Apache Avro <literal>MessageConverter</literal>, without a predefined schema:</simpara>

</section>
<section xml:id="_schema_registry_support">
<title>Schema Registry Support</title>
<simpara>Most serialization models, especially the ones that aim for portability across different platforms and languages, rely on a schema that describes how the data is serialized in the binary payload.
In order to serialize the data and then to interpret it, both the sending and receiving sides must have access to a schema that describes the binary format.
In certain cases, the schema can be inferred from the payload type on serialization, or from the target type on deserialization, but in a lot of cases applications benefit from having access to an explicit schema that describes the binary data format.
A schema registry allows you to store schema information in a textual format (typically JSON) and makes that information accessible to various applications that need it to receive and send data in binary format.
A schema is referenceable as a tuple consisting of:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>a <emphasis>subject</emphasis> that is the logical name of the schema;</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<title>Schema Registry Server</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides a schema registry server implementation.
In order to use it, you can simply add the <literal>spring-cloud-stream-schema-server</literal> artifact to your project and use the <literal>@EnableSchemaRegistryServer</literal> annotation, adding the schema registry server REST controller to your application.
This annotation is intended to be used with Spring Boot web applications, and the listening port of the server is controlled by the <literal>server.port</literal> setting.
The <literal>spring.cloud.stream.schema.server.path</literal> setting can be used to control the root path of the schema server (especially when it is embedded in other applications).
The <literal>spring.cloud.stream.schema.server.allowSchemaDeletion</literal> boolean setting enables the deletion of schema. By default this is disabled.</simpara>
<simpara>The schema registry server uses a relational database to store the schemas.
 By default, it uses an embedded database.
You can customize the schema storage using the <link xl:href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-sql">Spring Boot SQL database and JDBC configuration options</link>.</simpara>

<title>Avro Schema Registry Client Message Converters</title>
<simpara>For Spring Boot applications that have a <literal>SchemaRegistryClient</literal> bean registered with the application context, Spring Cloud Stream will auto-configure an Apache Avro message converter that uses the schema registry client for schema management.
This eases schema evolution, as applications that receive messages can get easy access to a writer schema that can be reconciled with their own reader schema.</simpara>
<simpara>For outbound messages, the <literal>MessageConverter</literal> will be activated if the content type of the channel is set to <literal>application/*+avro</literal>, e.g.:</simpara>
<programlisting language="properties" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.contentType=application/*+avro</programlisting>
<simpara>During the outbound conversion, the message converter will try to infer the schemas of the outbound messages based on their type and register them to a subject based on the payload type using the <literal>SchemaRegistryClient</literal>.
If an identical schema is already found, then a reference to it will be retrieved.
If not, the schema will be registered and a new version number will be provided.
The message will be sent with a <literal>contentType</literal> header using the scheme <literal>application/[prefix].[subject].v[version]+avro</literal>, where <literal>prefix</literal> is configurable and <literal>subject</literal> is deduced from the payload type.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, a message of the type <literal>User</literal> may be sent as a binary payload with a content type of <literal>application/vnd.user.v2+avro</literal>, where <literal>user</literal> is the subject and <literal>2</literal> is the version number.</simpara>
<simpara>When receiving messages, the converter will infer the schema reference from the header of the incoming message and will try to retrieve it. The schema will be used as the writer schema in the deserialization process.</simpara>

<simpara>To better understand how Spring Cloud Stream registers and resolves new schemas, as well as its use of Avro schema comparison features, we will provide two separate subsections below: one for the registration, and one for the resolution of schemas.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_schema_registration_process_serialization">
<title>Schema Registration Process (Serialization)</title>
<simpara>The first part of the registration process is extracting a schema from the payload that is being sent over a channel.
Avro types such as <literal>SpecificRecord</literal> or <literal>GenericRecord</literal> already contain a schema, which can be retrieved immediately from the instance.
In the case of POJOs a schema will be inferred if the property <literal>spring.cloud.stream.schema.avro.dynamicSchemaGenerationEnabled</literal> is set to <literal>true</literal> (the default).</simpara>

<simpara>Ones a schema is obtained, the converter will then load its metadata (version) from the remote server.

The converter will always cache the results to avoid the overhead of querying the Schema Server for every new message that needs to be serialized.</simpara>

<note>
<simpara>It&#8217;s important to understand the difference between a writer schema (the application that wrote the message) and a reader schema (the receiving application).
Please take a moment to read <link xl:href="https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.7.6/spec.html">the Avro terminology</link> and understand the process.
Spring Cloud Stream will always fetch the writer schema to determine how to read a message. If you want to get Avro&#8217;s schema evolution support working you need to make sure that a readerSchema was properly set for your application.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_connecting_multiple_application_instances">
<title>Connecting Multiple Application Instances</title>
<simpara>While Spring Cloud Stream makes it easy for individual Spring Boot applications to connect to messaging systems, the typical scenario for Spring Cloud Stream is the creation of multi-application pipelines, where microservice applications send data to each other.
You can achieve this scenario by correlating the input and output destinations of adjacent applications.</simpara>
<simpara>Supposing that a design calls for the Time Source application to send data to the Log Sink application, you can use a common destination named <literal>ticktock</literal> for bindings within both applications.</simpara>
<simpara>Time Source (that has the channel name <literal>output</literal>) will set the following property:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.destination=ticktock</screen>
<simpara>Log Sink (that has the channel name <literal>input</literal>) will set the following property:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=ticktock</screen>
</section>
<section xml:id="_instance_index_and_instance_count">
<title>Instance Index and Instance Count</title>
<simpara>When scaling up Spring Cloud Stream applications, each instance can receive information about how many other instances of the same application exist and what its own instance index is.
Spring Cloud Stream does this through the <literal>spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount</literal> and <literal>spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex</literal> properties.
For example, if there are three instances of a HDFS sink application, all three instances will have <literal>spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount</literal> set to <literal>3</literal>, and the individual applications will have <literal>spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex</literal> set to <literal>0</literal>, <literal>1</literal>, and <literal>2</literal>, respectively.</simpara>
<simpara>When Spring Cloud Stream applications are deployed via Spring Cloud Data Flow, these properties are configured automatically; when Spring Cloud Stream applications are launched independently, these properties must be set correctly.
By default, <literal>spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount</literal> is <literal>1</literal>, and <literal>spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex</literal> is <literal>0</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>In a scaled-up scenario, correct configuration of these two properties is important for addressing partitioning behavior (see below) in general, and the two properties are always required by certain binders (e.g., the Kafka binder) in order to ensure that data are split correctly across multiple consumer instances.</simpara>

<title>Partitioning</title>
<section xml:id="_configuring_output_bindings_for_partitioning">
<title>Configuring Output Bindings for Partitioning</title>
<simpara>An output binding is configured to send partitioned data by setting one and only one of its <literal>partitionKeyExpression</literal> or <literal>partitionKeyExtractorName</literal> (see next paragraph) properties, as well as its <literal>partitionCount</literal> property.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, the following is a valid and typical configuration:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionKeyExpression=payload.id
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionCount=5</screen>
<simpara>Based on the above example configuration, data will be sent to the target partition using the following logic.</simpara>
<simpara>A partition key&#8217;s value is calculated for each message sent to a partitioned output channel based on the <literal>partitionKeyExpression</literal>.
The <literal>partitionKeyExpression</literal> is a SpEL expression which is evaluated against the outbound message for extracting the partitioning key.</simpara>
<simpara>If a SpEL expression is not sufficient for your needs, you can instead calculate the partition key value by providing implementation of <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.PartitionKeyExtractorStrategy</literal> and configuring it as a bean (i.e., <literal>@Bean</literal>). In the event you have more then one bean of type <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.PartitionKeyExtractorStrategy</literal> available in the Application Context you can further filter it by specifying its name via <literal>partitionKeyExtractorName</literal> property:</simpara>
<screen>--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionKeyExtractorName=customPartitionKeyExtractor
--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionCount=5
. . .
@Bean
public CustomPartitionKeyExtractorClass customPartitionKeyExtractor() {
    return new CustomPartitionKeyExtractorClass();
}</screen>
<note>
<simpara>In previous versions of Spring Cloud Stream you could specify the implementation of <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.PartitionKeyExtractorStrategy</literal> as <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionKeyExtractorClass</literal> property. Since version 2.0 this property is deprecated and support for it will be removed in a future version.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Ones the message key is calculated, the partition selection process will determine the target partition as a value between <literal>0</literal> and <literal>partitionCount - 1</literal>.
The default calculation, applicable in most scenarios, is based on the formula <literal>key.hashCode() % partitionCount</literal>.
This can be customized on the binding, either by setting a SpEL expression to be evaluated against the 'key' (via the <literal>partitionSelectorExpression</literal> property) or by configuring an implementation of <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.PartitionSelectorStrategy</literal> as a bean (i.e., @Bean). And similarly to the <literal>PartitionKeyExtractorStrategy</literal> you can further filter it using <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionSelectorName</literal> property in the event there are more then one bean of this type is available in the Application Context.</simpara>
<screen>--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionSelectorName=customPartitionSelector
. . .
@Bean
public CustomPartitionSelectorClass customPartitionSelector() {
    return new CustomPartitionSelectorClass();
}</screen>
<note>

</note>
<section xml:id="_configuring_input_bindings_for_partitioning">
<title>Configuring Input Bindings for Partitioning</title>
<simpara>An input binding (with the channel name <literal>input</literal>) is configured to receive partitioned data by setting its <literal>partitioned</literal> property, as well as the <literal>instanceIndex</literal> and <literal>instanceCount</literal> properties on the application itself, as in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.consumer.partitioned=true
spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex=3
spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount=5</screen>
<simpara>The <literal>instanceCount</literal> value represents the total number of application instances between which the data need to be partitioned, and the <literal>instanceIndex</literal> must be a unique value across the multiple instances, between <literal>0</literal> and <literal>instanceCount - 1</literal>.
The instance index helps each application instance to identify the unique partition(s) from which it receives data.
It is required by binders using technology that doesn&#8217;t support partitioning natively, for example, with RabbitMQ, there is a queue for each partition, with the queue name containing the instance index.
With Kafka, if <literal>autoRebalanceEnabled</literal> is <literal>true</literal> (default), Kafka will take care of distributing partitions across instances and these properties are not required.
If <literal>autoRebalanceEnabled</literal> is set to false, the <literal>instanceCount</literal> and <literal>instanceIndex</literal> are used by the binder to determine which partition(s) the instance will subscribe to (you must have at least as many partitions as there are instances).
The binder will allocate the partitions instead of Kafka.
This might be useful if you want messages for a particular partition to always go to the same instance.
When a binder configuration that requires them, it is important to set both values correctly in order to ensure that all of the data is consumed and that the application instances receive mutually exclusive datasets.</simpara>
<simpara>While a scenario which using multiple instances for partitioned data processing may be complex to set up in a standalone case, Spring Cloud Dataflow can simplify the process significantly by populating both the input and output values correctly as well as relying on the runtime infrastructure to provide information about the instance index and instance count.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_testing">
<title>Testing</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides support for testing your microservice applications without connecting to a messaging system.
You can do that by using the <literal>TestSupportBinder</literal> provided by the <literal>spring-cloud-stream-test-support</literal> library, which can be added as a test dependency to the application:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">   &lt;dependency&gt;
       &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
       &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-stream-test-support&lt;/artifactId&gt;
       &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
   &lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>The <literal>TestSupportBinder</literal> uses the Spring Boot autoconfiguration mechanism to supersede the other binders found on the classpath.
Therefore, when adding a binder as a dependency, make sure that the <literal>test</literal> scope is being used.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>The <literal>TestSupportBinder</literal> allows users to interact with the bound channels and inspect what messages are sent and received by the application</simpara>
<simpara>For outbound message channels, the <literal>TestSupportBinder</literal> registers a single subscriber and retains the messages emitted by the application in a <literal>MessageCollector</literal>.
They can be retrieved during tests and have assertions made against them.</simpara>
<simpara>The user can also send messages to inbound message channels, so that the consumer application can consume the messages.
The following example shows how to test both input and output channels on a processor.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment= SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
public class ExampleTest {

  @Autowired
  private Processor processor;

  @Autowired
  private MessageCollector messageCollector;

  @Test
  @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
  public void testWiring() {
    Message&lt;String&gt; message = new GenericMessage&lt;&gt;("hello");
    processor.input().send(message);
    Message&lt;String&gt; received = (Message&lt;String&gt;) messageCollector.forChannel(processor.output()).poll();
    assertThat(received.getPayload(), equalTo("hello world"));
  }


  @SpringBootApplication
  @EnableBinding(Processor.class)
  public static class MyProcessor {

    @Autowired
    private Processor channels;

    @Transformer(inputChannel = Processor.INPUT, outputChannel = Processor.OUTPUT)
    public String transform(String in) {
      return in + " world";
    }
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In the example above, we are creating an application that has an input and an output channel, bound through the <literal>Processor</literal> interface.
The bound interface is injected into the test so we can have access to both channels.
We are sending a message on the input channel and we are using the <literal>MessageCollector</literal> provided by Spring Cloud Stream&#8217;s test support to capture the message has been sent to the output channel as a result.
Ones we have received the message, we can validate that the component functions correctly.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_disabling_the_test_binder_autoconfiguration">
<title>Disabling the test binder autoconfiguration</title>
<simpara>The intent behind the test binder superseding all the other binders on the classpath is to make it easy to test your applications without making changes to your production dependencies.
In some cases (e.g. integration tests) it is useful to use the actual production binders instead, and that requires disabling the test binder autoconfiguration.
In order to do so, you can exclude the <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.test.binder.TestSupportBinderAutoConfiguration</literal> class using one of the Spring Boot autoconfiguration exclusion mechanisms, as in the following example.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">    @SpringBootApplication(exclude = TestSupportBinderAutoConfiguration.class)
    @EnableBinding(Processor.class)

        public String transform(String in) {
            return in + " world";
        }
    }</programlisting>
<simpara>When autoconfiguration is disabled, the test binder is available on the classpath, and its <literal>defaultCandidate</literal> property is set to <literal>false</literal>, so that it does not interfere with the regular user configuration. It can be referenced under the name <literal>test</literal> e.g.:</simpara>

This module allow operators to collect metrics from stream applications without relying on polling their endpoints.</simpara>
<simpara>The module is activated when you set the destination name for metrics binding, e.g. <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.applicationMetrics.destination=&lt;DESTINATION_NAME&gt;</literal>.

<simpara>A detailed overview of the metrics export process can be found in the <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-metrics.html#production-ready-metric-writers">Spring Boot reference documentation</link>.
Spring Cloud Stream provides a metric exporter named <literal>application</literal> that can be configured via regular <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/1.5.x/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/metrics/export/TriggerProperties.java">Spring Boot metrics configuration properties</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>The exporter can be configured either by using the global Spring Boot configuration settings for exporters, or by using exporter-specific properties.
For using the global configuration settings, the properties should be prefixed by <literal>spring.metric.export</literal> (e.g. <literal>spring.metric.export.includes=integration**</literal>).
These configuration options will apply to all exporters (unless they have been configured differently).
Alternatively, if it is intended to use configuration settings that are different from the other exporters (e.g. for restricting the number of metrics published), the Spring Cloud Stream provided metrics exporter can be configured using the prefix <literal>spring.metrics.export.triggers.application</literal> (e.g. <literal>spring.metrics.export.triggers.application.includes=integration**</literal>).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Due to Spring Boot&#8217;s <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config-relaxed-binding">relaxed binding</link> the value of a property being included can be slightly different than the original value.</simpara>
<simpara>As a rule of thumb, the metric exporter will attempt to normalize all the properties in a consistent format using the dot notation (e.g. <literal>JAVA_HOME</literal> becomes <literal>java.home</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>The goal of normalization is to make downstream consumers of those metrics capable of receiving property names consistently, regardless of how they are set on the monitored application (<literal>--spring.application.name</literal> or <literal>SPRING_APPLICATION_NAME</literal> would always yield <literal>spring.application.name</literal>).</simpara>

<simpara>The Apache Kafka Binder implementation maps each destination to an Apache Kafka topic.
The consumer group maps directly to the same Apache Kafka concept.
Partitioning also maps directly to Apache Kafka partitions as well.</simpara>
<simpara>The binder currently uses the Apache Kafka <literal>kafka-clients</literal> 1.0.0 jar and is designed to be used with a broker at least that version.
This client can communicate with older brokers (refer to the Kafka documentation), but certain features may not be available.
For example, with versions earlier than 0.11.x.x, native headers are not supported.
Also, 0.11.x.x does not support the <literal>autoAddPartitions</literal> property.</simpara>

<title>Kafka Metrics</title>
<simpara>Kafka binder module exposes the following metrics:</simpara>
<simpara><literal>spring.cloud.stream.binder.kafka.someGroup.someTopic.lag</literal>  - this metric indicates how many messages have not been yet consumed from given binder&#8217;s topic by given consumer group.
For example if the value of the metric <literal>spring.cloud.stream.binder.kafka.myGroup.myTopic.lag</literal> is <literal>1000</literal>, then consumer group <literal>myGroup</literal> has <literal>1000</literal> messages to waiting to be consumed from topic <literal>myTopic</literal>.
This metric is particularly useful to provide auto-scaling feedback to PaaS platform of your choice.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="kafka-dlq-processing">
<title>Dead-Letter Topic Processing</title>
<simpara>Because it can&#8217;t be anticipated how users would want to dispose of dead-lettered messages, the framework does not provide any standard mechanism to handle them.
If the reason for the dead-lettering is transient, you may wish to route the messages back to the original topic.
However, if the problem is a permanent issue, that could cause an infinite loop.
The following <literal>spring-boot</literal> application is an example of how to route those messages back to the original topic, but moves them to a third "parking lot" topic after three attempts.
The application is simply another spring-cloud-stream application that reads from the dead-letter topic.
It terminates when no messages are received for 5 seconds.</simpara>
<simpara>The examples assume the original destination is <literal>so8400out</literal> and the consumer group is <literal>so8400</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>There are several considerations.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Consider only running the rerouting when the main application is not running.
Otherwise, the retries for transient errors will be used up very quickly.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Alternatively, use a two-stage approach - use this application to route to a third topic, and another to route from there back to the main topic.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Since this technique uses a message header to keep track of retries, it won&#8217;t work with <literal>headerMode=raw</literal>.
In that case, consider adding some data to the payload (that can be ignored by the main application).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>x-retries</literal> has to be added to the <literal>headers</literal> property <literal>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.headers=x-retries</literal> on both this, and the main application so that the header is transported between the applications.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Since kafka is publish/subscribe, replayed messages will be sent to each consumer group, even those that successfully processed a message the first time around.</simpara>

<simpara>The topic must be provisioned to have enough partitions to achieve the desired concurrency for all consumer groups.

<section xml:id="_kafka_streams_binder_overview">
<title>Kafka Streams Binder Overview</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream&#8217;s Apache Kafka support also includes a binder implementation designed explicitly for Apache Kafka
Streams binding. With this native integration, a Spring Cloud Stream "processor" application can directly use the
<link xl:href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/developer-guide">Apache Kafka Streams</link> APIs in the core business logic.</simpara>
<simpara>Kafka Streams binder implementation builds on the foundation provided by the <link xl:href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/reference/html/_reference.html#kafka-streams">Kafka Streams in Spring Kafka</link>
project.</simpara>
<simpara>As part of this native integration, the high-level <link xl:href="https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/developer-guide/dsl-api.html">Streams DSL</link>
provided by the Kafka Streams API is available for use in the business logic, too.</simpara>
<simpara>An early version of the <link xl:href="https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/developer-guide/processor-api.html">Processor API</link>
support is available as well.</simpara>
<simpara>As noted early-on, Kafka Streams support in Spring Cloud Stream strictly only available for use in the Processor model.
A model in which the messages read from an inbound topic, business processing can be applied, and the transformed messages
can be written to an outbound topic. It can also be used in Processor applications with a no-outbound destination.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_streams_dsl">
<title>Streams DSL</title>
<simpara>This application consumes data from a Kafka topic (e.g., <literal>words</literal>), computes word count for each unique word in a 5 seconds
time window, and the computed results are sent to a downstream topic (e.g., <literal>counts</literal>) for further processing.</simpara>
<screen>@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(KStreamProcessor.class)
public class WordCountProcessorApplication {

	@StreamListener("input")
	@SendTo("output")
	public KStream&lt;?, WordCount&gt; process(KStream&lt;?, String&gt; input) {
		return input
                .flatMapValues(value -&gt; Arrays.asList(value.toLowerCase().split("\\W+")))
                .groupBy((key, value) -&gt; value)
                .windowedBy(TimeWindows.of(5000))
                .count(Materialized.as("WordCounts-multi"))
                .toStream()
                .map((key, value) -&gt; new KeyValue&lt;&gt;(null, new WordCount(key.key(), value, new Date(key.window().start()), new Date(key.window().end()))));
    }

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(WordCountProcessorApplication.class, args);
	}</screen>
<simpara>Once built as a uber-jar (e.g., <literal>wordcount-processor.jar</literal>), you can run the above example like the following.</simpara>
<screen>java -jar wordcount-processor.jar  --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=words --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.destination=counts</screen>
<simpara>This application will consume messages from the Kafka topic <literal>words</literal> and the computed results are published to an output
topic <literal>counts</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream will ensure that the messages from both the incoming and outgoing topics are automatically bound as
KStream objects. As a developer, you can exclusively focus on the business aspects of the code, i.e. writing the logic
required in the processor. Setting up the Streams DSL specific configuration required by the Kafka Streams infrastructure
is automatically handled by the framework.</simpara>

<title>Multiple Output Bindings (aka Branching)</title>
<simpara>Kafka Streams allow outbound data to be split into multiple topics based on some predicates. The Kafka Streams binder provides
support for this feature without compromising the programming model exposed through <literal>StreamListener</literal> in the end user application.</simpara>
<simpara>You can write the application in the usual way as demonstrated above in the word count example. However, when using the
branching feature, you are required to do a few things. First, you need to make sure that your return type is <literal>KStream[]</literal>
instead of a regular <literal>KStream</literal>. Second, you need to use the <literal>SendTo</literal> annotation containing the output bindings in the order
(see example below). For each of these output bindings, you need to configure destination, content-type etc., complying with
the standard Spring Cloud Stream expectations.</simpara>
<simpara>Here is an example:</simpara>

<section xml:id="_message_conversion">
<title>Message Conversion</title>
<simpara>Similar to message-channel based binder applications, the Kafka Streams binder adapts to the out-of-the-box content-type
conversions without any compromise.</simpara>
<simpara>It is typical for Kafka Streams operations to know the type of SerDe’s used to transform the key and value correctly.
Therefore, it may be more natural to rely on the SerDe facilities provided by the Apache Kafka Streams library itself at
the inbound and outbound conversions rather than using the content-type conversions offered by the framework.
On the other hand, you might be already familiar with the content-type conversion patterns provided by the framework, and
that, you&#8217;d like to continue using for inbound and outbound conversions.</simpara>
<simpara>Both the options are supported in the Kafka Streams binder implementation.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_outbound_serialization">
<title>Outbound serialization</title>
<simpara>If native encoding is disabled (which is the default), then the framework will convert the message using the contentType
set by the user (otherwise, the default <literal>application/json</literal> will be applied). It will ignore any SerDe set on the outbound
in this case for outbound serialization.</simpara>
<simpara>Here is the property to set the contentType on the outbound.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.contentType: application/json</screen>
<simpara>Here is the property to enable native encoding.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.nativeEncoding: true</screen>
<simpara>If native encoding is enabled on the output binding (user has to enable it as above explicitly), then the framework will
skip any form of automatic message conversion on the outbound. In that case, it will switch to the Serde set by the user.
The <literal>valueSerde</literal> property set on the actual output binding will be used. Here is an example.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.output.producer.valueSerde: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serdes$StringSerde</screen>
<simpara>If this property is not set, then it will use the "default" SerDe: <literal>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.configuration.default.value.serde</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>It is worth to mention that Kafka Streams binder does not serialize the keys on outbound - it simply relies on Kafka itself.
Therefore, you either have to specify the <literal>keySerde</literal> property on the binding or it will default to the application-wide common
<literal>keySerde</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Binding level key serde:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.output.producer.keySerde</screen>
<simpara>Common Key serde:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.configuration.default.key.serde</screen>
<simpara>If branching is used, then you need to use multiple output bindings. For example,</simpara>
<screen>interface KStreamProcessorWithBranches {

    		@Input("input")
    		KStream&lt;?, ?&gt; input();

    		@Output("output1")
    		KStream&lt;?, ?&gt; output1();

    		@Output("output2")
    		KStream&lt;?, ?&gt; output2();

    		@Output("output3")
    		KStream&lt;?, ?&gt; output3();
    	}</screen>
<simpara>If <literal>nativeEncoding</literal> is set, then you can set different SerDe&#8217;s on individual output bindings as below.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kstream.bindings.output1.producer.valueSerde=IntegerSerde
spring.cloud.stream.kstream.bindings.output2.producer.valueSerde=StringSerde
spring.cloud.stream.kstream.bindings.output3.producer.valueSerde=JsonSerde</screen>
<simpara>Then if you have <literal>SendTo</literal> like this, @SendTo({"output1", "output2", "output3"}), the <literal>KStream[]</literal> from the branches are
applied with proper SerDe objects as defined above. If you are not enabling <literal>nativeEncoding</literal>, you can then set different
contentType values on the output bindings as below. In that case, the framework will use the appropriate message converter
to convert the messages before sending to Kafka.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output1.contentType: application/json
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output2.contentType: application/java-serialzied-object
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output3.contentType: application/octet-stream</screen>
</section>
<section xml:id="_inbound_deserialization">
<title>Inbound Deserialization</title>
<simpara>Similar rules apply to data deserialization on the inbound.</simpara>
<simpara>If native decoding is disabled (which is the default), then the framework will convert the message using the contentType
set by the user (otherwise, the default <literal>application/json</literal> will be applied). It will ignore any SerDe set on the inbound
in this case for inbound deserialization.</simpara>
<simpara>Here is the property to set the contentType on the inbound.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.contentType: application/json</screen>
<simpara>Here is the property to enable native decoding.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.nativeDecoding: true</screen>
<simpara>If native decoding is enabled on the input binding (user has to enable it as above explicitly), then the framework will
skip doing any message conversion on the inbound. In that case, it will switch to the SerDe set by the user. The <literal>valueSerde</literal>
property set on the actual output binding will be used. Here is an example.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.input.consumer.valueSerde: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serdes$StringSerde</screen>
<simpara>If this property is not set, it will use the default SerDe: <literal>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.configuration.default.value.serde</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>It is worth to mention that Kafka Streams binder does not deserialize the keys on inbound - it simply relies on Kafka itself.
Therefore, you either have to specify the <literal>keySerde</literal> property on the binding or it will default to the application-wide common
<literal>keySerde</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Binding level key serde:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.input.consumer.keySerde</screen>
<simpara>Common Key serde:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.configuration.default.key.serde</screen>
<simpara>As in the case of KStream branching on the outbound, the benefit of setting value SerDe per binding is that if you have
multiple input bindings (multiple KStreams object) and they all require separate value SerDe&#8217;s, then you can configure
them individually. If you use the common configuration approach, then this feature won&#8217;t be applicable.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_error_handling">
<title>Error Handling</title>
<simpara>Apache Kafka Streams provide the capability for natively handling exceptions from deserialization errors.
For details on this support, please see <link xl:href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-161%3A+streams+deserialization+exception+handlers">this</link>
Out of the box, Apache Kafka Streams provide two kinds of deserialization exception handlers - <literal>logAndContinue</literal> and <literal>logAndFail</literal>.
As the name indicates, the former will log the error and continue processing the next records and the latter will log the
error and fail. <literal>LogAndFail</literal> is the default deserialization exception handler.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_handling_deserialization_exceptions">
<title>Handling Deserialization Exceptions</title>
<simpara>Kafka Streams binder supports a selection of exception handlers through the following properties.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.serdeError: logAndContinue</screen>
<simpara>In addition to the above two deserialization exception handlers, the binder also provides a third one for sending the erroneous
records (poison pills) to a DLQ topic. Here is how you enable this DLQ exception handler.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.serdeError: sendToDlq</screen>
<simpara>When the above property is set, all the deserialization error records are automatically sent to the DLQ topic.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.input.consumer.dlqName: foo-dlq</screen>
<simpara>If this is set, then the error records are sent to the topic <literal>foo-dlq</literal>. If this is not set, then it will create a DLQ
topic with the name <literal>error.&lt;input-topic-name&gt;.&lt;group-name&gt;</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>A couple of things to keep in mind when using the exception handling feature in Kafka Streams binder.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>The property <literal>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.serdeError</literal> is applicable for the entire application. This implies
that if there are multiple <literal>StreamListener</literal> methods in the same application, this property is applied to all of them.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The exception handling for deserialization works consistently with native deserialization and framework provided message
conversion.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>
<section xml:id="_handling_non_deserialization_exceptions">
<title>Handling Non-Deserialization Exceptions</title>
<simpara>For general error handling in Kafka Streams binder, it is up to the end user applications to handle application level errors.
As a side effect of providing a DLQ for deserialization exception handlers, Kafka Streams binder provides a way to get
access to the DLQ sending bean directly from your application.
Once you get access to that bean, you can programmatically send any exception records from your application to the DLQ.</simpara>
<simpara>It continues to remain hard to robust error handling using the high-level DSL; Kafka Streams doesn&#8217;t natively support error
handling yet.</simpara>
<simpara>However, when you use the low-level Processor API in your application, there are options to control this behavior. See
below.</simpara>
<screen>@Autowired
private SendToDlqAndContinue dlqHandler;

@StreamListener("input")
@SendTo("output")
public KStream&lt;?, WordCount&gt; process(KStream&lt;Object, String&gt; input) {

    input.process(() -&gt; new Processor() {
    			ProcessorContext context;

    			@Override
    			public void init(ProcessorContext context) {
    				this.context = context;
    			}

    			    }
    			    catch(Exception e) {
    			        //explicitly provide the kafka topic corresponding to the input binding as the first argument.
                        //DLQ handler will correctly map to the dlq topic from the actual incoming destination.
                        dlqHandler.sendToDlq("topic-name", (byte[]) o1, (byte[]) o2, context.partition());

<simpara>The RabbitMQ Binder implementation maps each destination to a <literal>TopicExchange</literal> (by default).
For each consumer group, a <literal>Queue</literal> will be bound to that <literal>TopicExchange</literal>.
Each consumer instance have a corresponding RabbitMQ <literal>Consumer</literal> instance for its group&#8217;s <literal>Queue</literal>.
For partitioned producers/consumers the queues are suffixed with the partition index and use the partition index as routing key.
For anonymous consumers (no <literal>group</literal> property) an auto-delete queue is used, with a randomized unique name.</simpara>
<simpara>Using the optional <literal>autoBindDlq</literal> option, you can configure the binder to create and configure dead-letter queues (DLQs) (and a dead-letter exchange <literal>DLX</literal> as well as routing infrastructure).
By default, the dead letter queue has the name of the destination, appended with <literal>.dlq</literal>.
If retry is enabled (<literal>maxAttempts &gt; 1</literal>) failed messages will be delivered to the DLQ after retries are exhausted.
If retry is disabled (<literal>maxAttempts = 1</literal>), you should set <literal>requeueRejected</literal> to <literal>false</literal> (default) so that a failed message will be routed to the DLQ, instead of being requeued.
In addition, <literal>republishToDlq</literal> causes the binder to publish a failed message to the DLQ (instead of rejecting it); this enables additional information to be added to the message in headers, such as the stack trace in the <literal>x-exception-stacktrace</literal> header.
This option does not need retry enabled; you can republish a failed message after just one attempt.
Starting with <emphasis>version 1.2</emphasis>, you can configure the delivery mode of republished messages; see property <literal>republishDeliveryMode</literal>.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>Setting <literal>requeueRejected</literal> to <literal>true</literal> (with <literal>republishToDlq=false</literal> ) will cause the message to be requeued and redelivered continually, which is likely not what you want unless the reason for the failure is transient.
In general, it&#8217;s better to enable retry within the binder by setting <literal>maxAttempts</literal> to greater than one, or set <literal>republishToDlq</literal> to <literal>true</literal>.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>See <xref linkend="rabbit-binder-properties"/> for more information about these properties.</simpara>
<simpara>The framework does not provide any standard mechanism to consume dead-letter messages (or to re-route them back to the primary queue).
Some options are described in <xref linkend="rabbit-dlq-processing"/>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>When <emphasis role="strong">multiple</emphasis> RabbitMQ binders are used in a Spring Cloud Stream application, it is important to disable 'RabbitAutoConfiguration' to avoid the same configuration from <literal>RabbitAutoConfiguration</literal> being applied to the two binders.
Exclude the class using the <literal>@SpringBootApplication</literal> annotation.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Starting with <emphasis>version 2.0</emphasis>, the <literal>RabbitMessageChannelBinder</literal> sets the <literal>RabbitTemplate.userPublisherConnection</literal> property to true so that the non-transactional producers will avoid dead locks on consumers which can happen if cached connections are blocked because of <link xl:href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/memory.html">Memory Alarm</link> on Broker.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_retry_with_the_rabbitmq_binder">
<title>Retry With the RabbitMQ Binder</title>
<section xml:id="_overview">
<title>Overview</title>
<simpara>When retry is enabled within the binder, the listener container thread is suspended for any back off periods that are configured.
This might be important when strict ordering is required with a single consumer but for other use cases it prevents other messages from being processed on that thread.
An alternative to using binder retry is to set up dead lettering with time to live on the dead-letter queue (DLQ), as well as dead-letter configuration on the DLQ itself.
See <xref linkend="rabbit-binder-properties"/> for more information about the properties discussed here.
Example configuration to enable this feature:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Set <literal>autoBindDlq</literal> to <literal>true</literal> - the binder will create a DLQ; you can optionally specify a name in <literal>deadLetterQueueName</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Set <literal>dlqTtl</literal> to the back off time you want to wait between redeliveries</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Set the <literal>dlqDeadLetterExchange</literal> to the default exchange - expired messages from the DLQ will be routed to the original queue since the default <literal>deadLetterRoutingKey</literal> is the queue name (<literal>destination.group</literal>) - setting to the default exchange is achieved by setting the property with no value, as is shown in the example below</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>To force a message to be dead-lettered, either throw an <literal>AmqpRejectAndDontRequeueException</literal>, or set <literal>requeueRejected</literal> to <literal>true</literal> (default) and throw any exception.</simpara>
<simpara>The loop will continue without end, which is fine for transient problems but you may want to give up after some number of attempts.
Fortunately, RabbitMQ provides the <literal>x-death</literal> header which allows you to determine how many cycles have occurred.</simpara>
<simpara>To acknowledge a message after giving up, throw an <literal>ImmediateAcknowledgeAmqpException</literal>.</simpara>

<title>Error Channels</title>
<simpara>Starting with <emphasis>version 1.3</emphasis>, the binder unconditionally sends exceptions to an error channel for each consumer destination, and can be configured to send async producer send failures to an error channel too.
See <xref linkend="binder-error-channels"/> for more information.</simpara>
<simpara>With rabbitmq, there are two types of send failures:</simpara>

<simpara>The latter is rare; quoting the RabbitMQ documentation "[A nack] will only be delivered if an internal error occurs in the Erlang process responsible for a queue.".</simpara>
<simpara>As well as enabling producer error channels as described in <xref linkend="binder-error-channels"/>, the RabbitMQ binder will only send messages to the channels if the connection factory is appropriately configured:</simpara>

</section>
<section xml:id="rabbit-dlq-processing">
<title>Dead-Letter Queue Processing</title>
<simpara>Because it can&#8217;t be anticipated how users would want to dispose of dead-lettered messages, the framework does not provide any standard mechanism to handle them.
If the reason for the dead-lettering is transient, you may wish to route the messages back to the original queue.
However, if the problem is a permanent issue, that could cause an infinite loop.
The following <literal>spring-boot</literal> application is an example of how to route those messages back to the original queue, but moves them to a third "parking lot" queue after three attempts.
The second example utilizes the <link xl:href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2015/04/16/scheduling-messages-with-rabbitmq/">RabbitMQ Delayed Message Exchange</link> to introduce a delay to the requeued message.
In this example, the delay increases for each attempt.
These examples use a <literal>@RabbitListener</literal> to receive messages from the DLQ, you could also use <literal>RabbitTemplate.receive()</literal> in a batch process.</simpara>
<simpara>The examples assume the original destination is <literal>so8400in</literal> and the consumer group is <literal>so8400</literal>.</simpara>

<title>Spring Cloud Bus</title>
<partintro>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Bus links nodes of a distributed system with a lightweight message broker. This can then be used to broadcast state changes (e.g. configuration changes) or other management instructions. A key idea is that the Bus is like a distributed Actuator for a Spring Boot application that is scaled out, but it can also be used as a communication channel between apps. Starters are provided for an AMQP broker as the transport or for Kafka, but the same basic feature set (and some more depending on the transport) is on the roadmap for other transports.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Spring Cloud is released under the non-restrictive Apache 2.0 license. If you would like to contribute to this section of the documentation or if you find an error, please find the source code and issue trackers in the project at <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config/tree/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc">github</link>.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_quick_start_3">
<title>Quick Start</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Bus works by adding Spring Boot autconfiguration if it detects itself on the classpath. All you need to do to enable the bus is to add <literal>spring-cloud-starter-bus-amqp</literal> or <literal>spring-cloud-starter-bus-kafka</literal> to your dependency management and Spring Cloud takes care of the rest. Make sure the broker (RabbitMQ or Kafka) is available and configured: running on localhost you shouldn&#8217;t have to do anything, but if you are running remotely use Spring Cloud Connectors, or Spring Boot conventions to define the broker credentials, e.g. for Rabbit</simpara>

  rabbitmq:
    host: mybroker.com
    port: 5672
    username: user
    password: secret</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>The bus currently supports sending messages to all nodes listening or all nodes for a particular service (as defined by Eureka).  More selector criteria may be added in the future (ie. only service X nodes in data center Y, etc&#8230;&#8203;). There are also some http endpoints under the <literal>/bus/*</literal> actuator namespace.  There are currently two implemented.  The first, <literal>/bus/env</literal>, sends key/value pairs to update each node&#8217;s Spring Environment.  The second, <literal>/bus/refresh</literal>, will reload each application&#8217;s configuration, just as if they had all been pinged on their <literal>/refresh</literal> endpoint.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The Bus starters cover Rabbit and Kafka, because those are the two most common implementations, but Spring Cloud Stream is quite flexible and binder will work combined with <literal>spring-cloud-bus</literal>.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_addressing_an_instance">
<title>Addressing an Instance</title>
<simpara>Each instance of the application has a service ID, whose value can be set using <literal>spring.cloud.bus.id</literal>, and whose value is expected to be a colon-separated list of identifiers, in order of least specific to most specific. The default value is constructed from the environment as a combination of the <literal>spring.application.name</literal> and <literal>server.port</literal> (or <literal>spring.application.index</literal> if set). The default value of the ID is constructed in the form <literal>app:index:id</literal> where:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>app</literal> is the <literal>vcap.application.name</literal> if it exists, or <literal>spring.application.name</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>index</literal> is the <literal>vcap.application.instance_index</literal> if it exists, or else <literal>spring.application.index</literal>, or else <literal>local.server.port</literal> (or <literal>server.port</literal> or <literal>0</literal>).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>id</literal> is the <literal>vcap.application.instance_id</literal> if it exists, or else a random value.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The HTTP endpoints accept a "destination" parameter, e.g. "/bus/refresh?destination=customers:9000", where the destination is a service ID. If the ID is owned by an instance on the Bus then it will process the message and all other instances will ignore it.</simpara>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_addressing_all_instances_of_a_service">
<title>Addressing all instances of a service</title>
<simpara>The "destination" parameter is used in a Spring <literal>PathMatcher</literal> (with the path separator as a colon <literal>:</literal>) to determine if an instance will process the message.   Using the example from above, "/bus/refresh?destination=customers:**" will  target  all instances of the "customers" service regardless of the rest of the service ID.</simpara>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_service_id_must_be_unique">
<title>Service ID must be unique</title>
<simpara>The bus tries to eliminate processing an event twice, once from the original <literal>ApplicationEvent</literal> and once from the queue.  To do this, it checks the sending service ID againts the current service ID.  If multiple instances of a service have the same ID, events will not be processed.  Running on a local machine, each service will be on a different port and that will be part of the ID.  Cloud Foundry supplies an index to differentiate.  To ensure that the ID is unique outside Cloud Foundry, set <literal>spring.application.index</literal> to something unique for each instance of a service.</simpara>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_customizing_the_message_broker">
<title>Customizing the Message Broker</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Bus uses
<link xl:href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream">Spring Cloud Stream</link> to
broadcast the messages so to get messages to flow you only need to
include the binder implementation of your choice in the
classpath. There are convenient starters specifically for the bus with
AMQP (RabbitMQ) and Kafka
(<literal>spring-cloud-starter-bus-[amqp,kafka]</literal>). Generally speaking
Spring Cloud Stream relies on Spring Boot autoconfiguration
conventions for configuring middleware, so for instance the AMQP
broker address can be changed with <literal>spring.rabbitmq.*</literal>
configuration properties. Spring Cloud Bus has a handful of native
configuration properties in <literal>spring.cloud.bus.*</literal>
(e.g. <literal>spring.cloud.bus.destination</literal> is the name of the topic to use
the the externall middleware). Normally the defaults will suffice.</simpara>
<simpara>To lean more about how to customize the message broker settings
consult the Spring Cloud Stream documentation.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_tracing_bus_events">
<title>Tracing Bus Events</title>
<simpara>Bus events (subclasses of <literal>RemoteApplicationEvent</literal>) can be traced by
setting <literal>spring.cloud.bus.trace.enabled=true</literal>. If you do this then the
Spring Boot <literal>TraceRepository</literal> (if it is present) will show each event
sent and all the acks from each service instance. Example (from the
<literal>/trace</literal> endpoint):</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{

}</programlisting>
<simpara>This trace shows that a <literal>RefreshRemoteApplicationEvent</literal> was sent from
<literal>customers:9000</literal>, broadcast to all services, and it was received
(acked) by <literal>customers:9000</literal> and <literal>stores:8081</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To handle the ack signals yourself you could add an <literal>@EventListener</literal>
for the <literal>AckRemoteApplicationEvent</literal> and <literal>SentApplicationEvent</literal> types
to your app (and enable tracing). Or you could tap into the
<literal>TraceRepository</literal> and mine the data from there.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Any Bus application can trace acks, but sometimes it will be
useful to do this in a central service that can do more complex
queries on the data. Or forward it to a specialized tracing service.</simpara>
</note>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_broadcasting_your_own_events">
<title>Broadcasting Your Own Events</title>
<simpara>The Bus can carry any event of type <literal>RemoteApplicationEvent</literal>, but the
default transport is JSON and the deserializer needs to know which
types are going to be used ahead of time. To register a new type it
needs to be in a subpackage of <literal>org.springframework.cloud.bus.event</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To customise the event name you can use <literal>@JsonTypeName</literal> on your custom class
or rely on the default strategy which is to use the simple name of the class.
Note that both the producer and the consumer will need access to the class
definition.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_registering_events_in_custom_packages">
<title>Registering events in custom packages</title>
<simpara>If you cannot or don&#8217;t want to use a subpackage of <literal>org.springframework.cloud.bus.event</literal>
for your custom events, you must specify which packages to scan for events of
type <literal>RemoteApplicationEvent</literal> using <literal>@RemoteApplicationEventScan</literal>. Packages
specified with <literal>@RemoteApplicationEventScan</literal> include subpackages.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, if you have a custom event called <literal>FooEvent</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">package com.acme;

public class FooEvent extends RemoteApplicationEvent {
    ...
}</programlisting>
<simpara>you can register this event with the deserializer in the following way:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">package com.acme;

@Configuration
@RemoteApplicationEventScan
public class BusConfiguration {
    ...
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Without specifying a value, the package of the class where <literal>@RemoteApplicationEventScan</literal>
is used will be registered. In this example <literal>com.acme</literal> will be registered using the
package of <literal>BusConfiguration</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>You can also explicitly specify the packages to scan using the <literal>value</literal>, <literal>basePackages</literal> or
<literal>basePackageClasses</literal> properties on <literal>@RemoteApplicationEventScan</literal>. For example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">package com.acme;

@Configuration
//@RemoteApplicationEventScan({"com.acme", "foo.bar"})
//@RemoteApplicationEventScan(basePackages = {"com.acme", "foo.bar", "fizz.buzz"})
@RemoteApplicationEventScan(basePackageClasses = BusConfiguration.class)
public class BusConfiguration {
    ...
}</programlisting>
<simpara>All examples of <literal>@RemoteApplicationEventScan</literal> above are equivalent,
in that the <literal>com.acme</literal> package will be registered by explicitly specifying the
packages on <literal>@RemoteApplicationEventScan</literal>. Note, you can specify multiple base
packages to scan.</simpara>

<note>
<simpara>When you pick a particular trace, you see merged spans.
That means that, if there were two spans sent to Zipkin with Server Received and Server Sent or Client Received and Client Sent annotations, they are presented as a single span.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Why is there a difference between the seven and four spans in this case?</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Two spans come from the <literal>http:/start</literal> span. It has the Server Received (<literal>sr</literal>) and Server Sent (<literal>ss</literal>) annotations.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Two spans come from the RPC call from <literal>service1</literal> to <literal>service2</literal> to the <literal>http:/foo</literal> endpoint.
The Client Sent (<literal>cs</literal>) and Client Received (<literal>cr</literal>) events took place on the <literal>service1</literal> side.
Server Received (<literal>sr</literal>) and Server Sent (<literal>ss</literal>) events took place on the <literal>service2</literal> side.
These two spans form one logical span related to an RPC call.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Two spans come from the RPC call from <literal>service2</literal> to <literal>service3</literal> to the <literal>http:/bar</literal> endpoint.
The Client Sent (<literal>cs</literal>) and Client Received (<literal>cr</literal>) events took place on the <literal>service2</literal> side.
The Server Received (<literal>sr</literal>) and Server Sent (<literal>ss</literal>) events took place on the <literal>service3</literal> side.
These two spans form one logical span related to an RPC call.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Two spans come from the RPC call from <literal>service2</literal> to <literal>service4</literal> to the <literal>http:/baz</literal> endpoint.
The Client Sent (<literal>cs</literal>) and Client Received (<literal>cr</literal>) events took place on the <literal>service2</literal> side.
Server Received (<literal>sr</literal>) and Server Sent (<literal>ss</literal>) events took place on the <literal>service4</literal> side.
These two spans form one logical span related to an RPC call.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>So, if we count the physical spans, we have one from <literal>http:/start</literal>, two from <literal>service1</literal> calling <literal>service2</literal>, two from <literal>service2</literal>
calling <literal>service3</literal>, and two from <literal>service2</literal> calling <literal>service4</literal>. In sum, we have a total of seven spans.</simpara>
<simpara>Logically, we see the information of four total Spans because we have one span related to the incoming request
to <literal>service1</literal> and three spans related to RPC calls.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_visualizing_errors">
<title>Visualizing errors</title>
<simpara>Zipkin lets you visualize errors in your trace.
When an exception was thrown and was not caught, we set proper tags on the span, which Zipkin can then properly colorize.
You could see in the list of traces one trace that is red. That appears because an exception was thrown.</simpara>
<simpara>If you click that trace, you see a similar picture, as follows:</simpara>

Consequently, Sleuth no longer takes care of storing the context but delegates that work to Brave.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_propagating_span_context">
<title>Propagating Span Context</title>
<simpara>The span context is the state that must get propagated to any child spans across process boundaries.
Part of the Span Context is the Baggage. The trace and span IDs are a required part of the span context.
Baggage is an optional part.</simpara>
<simpara>Baggage is a set of key:value pairs stored in the span context.
Baggage travels together with the trace and is attached to every span.
Spring Cloud Sleuth understands that a header is baggage-related if the HTTP header is prefixed with <literal>baggage-</literal> and, for messaging, it starts with <literal>baggage_</literal>.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>There is currently no limitation of the count or size of baggage items.
However, keep in mind that too many can decrease system throughput or increase RPC latency.
In extreme cases, too much baggage can crash the application, due to exceeding transport-level message or header capacity.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>The following example shows setting baggage on a span:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">Span initialSpan = this.tracer.nextSpan().name("span").start();
try (Tracer.SpanInScope ws = this.tracer.withSpanInScope(initialSpan)) {
	ExtraFieldPropagation.set("foo", "bar");
	ExtraFieldPropagation.set("UPPER_CASE", "someValue");
}</programlisting>
<section xml:id="_baggage_versus_span_tags">
<title>Baggage versus Span Tags</title>
<simpara>Baggage travels with the trace (every child span contains the baggage of its parent).
Zipkin has no knowledge of baggage and does not receive that information.</simpara>
<simpara>Tags are attached to a specific span. In other words, they are presented only for that particular span.
However, you can search by tag to find the trace, assuming a span having the searched tag value exists.</simpara>
<simpara>If you want to be able to lookup a span based on baggage, you should add a corresponding entry as a tag in the root span.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>The span must be in scope.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>The following listing shows integration tests that use baggage:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">initialSpan.tag("foo",
		ExtraFieldPropagation.get(initialSpan.context(), "foo"));

<section xml:id="_introduction_to_brave">
<title>Introduction to Brave</title>
<important>
<simpara>Starting with version <literal>2.0.0</literal>, Spring Cloud Sleuth uses
<link xl:href="https://github.com/openzipkin/brave">Brave</link> as the tracing library.
For your convenience, we embed part of the Brave&#8217;s docs here.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>Brave is a library used to capture and report latency information about distributed operations to Zipkin.
Most users do not use Brave directly. They use libraries or frameworks rather than employ Brave on their behalf.</simpara>
<simpara>This module includes a tracer that creates and joins spans that model the latency of potentially distributed work.
It also includes libraries to propagate the trace context over network boundaries (for example, with HTTP headers).</simpara>
<section xml:id="_tracing">
<title>Tracing</title>
<simpara>Most importantly, you need a <literal>brave.Tracer</literal>, configured to <link xl:href="https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java">report to Zipkin</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example setup sends trace data (spans) to Zipkin over HTTP (as opposed to Kafka):</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">class MyClass {

    private final Tracer tracer;

    // Tracer will be autowired
    MyClass(Tracer tracer) {
        this.tracer = tracer;
    }

    void doSth() {
        Span span = tracer.newTrace().name("encode").start();
        // ...
    }
}</programlisting>
<important>
<simpara>If your span contains a name longer than 50 chars, then that name is truncated to 50 chars.
Your names have to be explicit and concrete.
Big names lead to latency issues and sometimes even thrown exceptions.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>The tracer creates and joins spans that model the latency of potentially distributed work.
It can employ sampling to reduce overhead during the process, to reduce the amount of data sent to Zipkin, or both.</simpara>
<simpara>Spans returned by a tracer report data to Zipkin when finished or do nothing if unsampled.
After starting a span, you can annotate events of interest or add tags containing details or lookup keys.</simpara>
<simpara>Spans have a context that includes trace identifiers that place the span at the correct spot in the tree representing the distributed operation.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_local_tracing">
<title>Local Tracing</title>
<simpara>When tracing local code, you can run it inside a span, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">Span span = tracer.newTrace().name("encode").start();
try {
  doSomethingExpensive();
} finally {
  span.finish();
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In the preceding example, the span is the root of the trace.
In many cases, the span is part of an existing trace.
When this is the case, call <literal>newChild</literal> instead of <literal>newTrace</literal>, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">Span span = tracer.newChild(root.context()).name("encode").start();
try {
  doSomethingExpensive();
} finally {
  span.finish();
}</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_customizing_spans">
<title>Customizing Spans</title>
<simpara>Once you have a span, you can add tags to it.
The tags can be used as lookup keys or details.
For example, you might add a tag with your runtime version, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">span.tag("clnt/finagle.version", "6.36.0");</programlisting>
<simpara>When exposing the ability to customize spans to third parties, prefer <literal>brave.SpanCustomizer</literal> as opposed to <literal>brave.Span</literal>.
The former is simpler to understand and test and does not tempt users with span lifecycle hooks.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">interface MyTraceCallback {
  void request(Request request, SpanCustomizer customizer);
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Since <literal>brave.Span</literal> implements <literal>brave.SpanCustomizer</literal>, you can pass it to users, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">for (MyTraceCallback callback : userCallbacks) {
  callback.request(request, span);
}</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_implicitly_looking_up_the_current_span">
<title>Implicitly Looking up the Current Span</title>
<simpara>Sometimes, you do not know if a trace is in progress or not, and you do not want users to do null checks.
<literal>brave.CurrentSpanCustomizer</literal> handles this problem by adding data to any span that&#8217;s in progress or drops, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<simpara>Ex.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// The user code can then inject this without a chance of it being null.
@Autowire SpanCustomizer span;

void userCode() {
  span.annotate("tx.started");
  ...
}</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_rpc_tracing">
<title>RPC tracing</title>
<tip>
<simpara>Check for <link xl:href="https://github.com/openzipkin/sleuth/tree/master/instrumentation">instrumentation written here</link> and <link xl:href="http://zipkin.io/pages/existing_instrumentations.html">Zipkin&#8217;s list</link> before rolling your own RPC instrumentation.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>RPC tracing is often done automatically by interceptors. Behind the scenes, they add tags and events that relate to their role in an RPC operation.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows how to add a client span:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// before you send a request, add metadata that describes the operation
span = tracer.newTrace().name("get").type(CLIENT);
span.tag("clnt/finagle.version", "6.36.0");
span.tag(TraceKeys.HTTP_PATH, "/api");
span.remoteEndpoint(Endpoint.builder()
    .serviceName("backend")
    .ipv4(127 &lt;&lt; 24 | 1)
    .port(8080).build());

// when the request is scheduled, start the span
span.start();

// if you have callbacks for when data is on the wire, note those events
span.annotate(Constants.WIRE_SEND);
span.annotate(Constants.WIRE_RECV);

// when the response is complete, finish the span
span.finish();</programlisting>
<section xml:id="_one_way_tracing">
<title>One-Way tracing</title>
<simpara>Sometimes, you need to model an asynchronous operation where there is a
request but no response. In normal RPC tracing, you use <literal>span.finish()</literal>
to indicate that the response was received. In one-way tracing, you use
<literal>span.flush()</literal> instead, as you do not expect a response.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows how a client might model a one-way operation:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// start a new span representing a client request
oneWaySend = tracer.newSpan(parent).kind(Span.Kind.CLIENT);

// Add the trace context to the request, so it can be propagated in-band
tracing.propagation().injector(Request::addHeader)
                     .inject(oneWaySend.context(), request);

// fire off the request asynchronously, totally dropping any response
request.execute();

// start the client side and flush instead of finish
oneWaySend.start().flush();</programlisting>
<simpara>The following example shows how a server might handle a one-way operation:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// pull the context out of the incoming request
extractor = tracing.propagation().extractor(Request::getHeader);

// convert that context to a span which you can name and add tags to
oneWayReceive = nextSpan(tracer, extractor.extract(request))
    .name("process-request")
    .kind(SERVER)
    ... add tags etc.

// start the server side and flush instead of finish
oneWayReceive.start().flush();

// you should not modify this span anymore as it is complete. However,
// you can create children to represent follow-up work.
next = tracer.newSpan(oneWayReceive.context()).name("step2").start();</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>The propagation logic shown in the preceding example is a simplified version of our [http handlers](<link xl:href="https://github.com/openzipkin/sleuth/tree/master/instrumentation/http#http-server">https://github.com/openzipkin/sleuth/tree/master/instrumentation/http#http-server</link>).</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_sampling">
<title>Sampling</title>
<simpara>Sampling may be employed to reduce the data collected and reported out of process.
When a span is not sampled, it adds no overhead (a noop).</simpara>
<simpara>Sampling is an up-front decision, meaning that the decision to report data is made at the first operation in a trace and that decision is propagated downstream.</simpara>
<simpara>By default, a global sampler applies a single rate to all traced operations.
<literal>Tracer.Builder.sampler</literal> controls this setting, and it defaults to tracing every request.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_declarative_sampling">
<title>Declarative sampling</title>
<simpara>Some applications need to sample based on the type or annotations of a java method.</simpara>
<simpara>Most users use a framework interceptor to automate this sort of policy.
The following example shows how that might work internally:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// derives a sample rate from an annotation on a java method
DeclarativeSampler&lt;Traced&gt; sampler = DeclarativeSampler.create(Traced::sampleRate);

@Around("@annotation(traced)")
public Object traceThing(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp, Traced traced) throws Throwable {
  Span span = tracing.tracer().newTrace(sampler.sample(traced))...
  try {
    return pjp.proceed();
  } finally {
    span.finish();
  }
}</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_custom_sampling">
<title>Custom sampling</title>
<simpara>Depending on what the operation is, you may want to apply different policies.
For example, you might not want to trace requests to static resources such as images, or you might want to trace all requests to a new api.</simpara>
<simpara>Most users use a framework interceptor to automate this sort of policy.
The following example shows how that might work internally:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">Span newTrace(Request input) {
  SamplingFlags flags = SamplingFlags.NONE;
  if (input.url().startsWith("/experimental")) {
    flags = SamplingFlags.SAMPLED;
  } else if (input.url().startsWith("/static")) {
    flags = SamplingFlags.NOT_SAMPLED;
  }
  return tracer.newTrace(flags);
}</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>The preceding example forms the basis for the built-in <link xl:href="https://github.com/openzipkin/sleuth/tree/master/instrumentation/http">http sampler</link>.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_sampling_in_spring_cloud_sleuth">
<title>Sampling in Spring Cloud Sleuth</title>
<simpara>By default Spring Cloud Sleuth sets all spans to non-exportable.
That means that traces appear in logs but not in any remote store.
For testing the default is often enough, and it probably is all you need if you use only the logs (for example, with an ELK aggregator).
If you export span data to Zipkin, there is also an <literal>Sampler.ALWAYS_SAMPLE</literal> setting that exports everything and a <literal>ProbabilityBasedSampler</literal> setting that samples a fixed fraction of spans.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The <literal>ProbabilityBasedSampler</literal> is the default if you use <literal>spring-cloud-sleuth-zipkin</literal>.
You can configure the exports by setting <literal>spring.sleuth.sampler.probability</literal>.
The passed value needs to be a double from <literal>0.0</literal> to <literal>1.0</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>A sampler can be installed by creating a bean definition, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public Sampler defaultSampler() {
	return Sampler.ALWAYS_SAMPLE;
}</programlisting>
<tip>
<simpara>You can set the HTTP header <literal>X-B3-Flags</literal> to <literal>1</literal>, or, when doing messaging, you can set the <literal>spanFlags</literal> header to <literal>1</literal>.
Doing so forces the current span to be exportable regardless of the sampling decision.</simpara>
</tip>
</section>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_propagation">
<title>Propagation</title>
<simpara>Propagation is needed to ensure activities originating from the same root are collected together in the same trace.
The most common propagation approach is to copy a trace context from a client by sending an RPC request to a server receiving it.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, when a downstream HTTP call is made, its trace context is encoded as request headers and sent along with it, as shown in the following image:</simpara>

<simpara>The names above are from <link xl:href="https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation">B3 Propagation</link>, which is built-in to Brave and has implementations in many languages and frameworks.</simpara>
<simpara>Most users use a framework interceptor to automate propagation.
The next two examples show how that might work for a client and a server.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows how client-side propagation might work:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// configure a function that injects a trace context into a request
injector = tracing.propagation().injector(Request.Builder::addHeader);

// before a request is sent, add the current span's context to it
injector.inject(span.context(), request);</programlisting>
<simpara>The following example shows how server-side propagation might work:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// configure a function that extracts the trace context from a request
extracted = tracing.propagation().extractor(Request::getHeader);

// when a server receives a request, it joins or starts a new trace
span = tracer.nextSpan(extracted, request);</programlisting>
<section xml:id="_propagating_extra_fields">
<title>Propagating extra fields</title>
<simpara>Sometimes you need to propagate extra fields, such as a request ID or an alternate trace context.
For example, if you are in a Cloud Foundry environment, you might want to pass the request ID, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// when you initialize the builder, define the extra field you want to propagate
tracingBuilder.propagationFactory(
  ExtraFieldPropagation.newFactory(B3Propagation.FACTORY, "x-vcap-request-id")
);

// later, you can tag that request ID or use it in log correlation
requestId = ExtraFieldPropagation.get("x-vcap-request-id");</programlisting>
<simpara>You may also need to propagate a trace context that you are not using.
For example, you may be in an Amazon Web Services environment but not be reporting data to X-Ray.
To ensure X-Ray can co-exist correctly, pass-through its tracing header, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">tracingBuilder.propagationFactory(
  ExtraFieldPropagation.newFactory(B3Propagation.FACTORY, "x-amzn-trace-id")
);</programlisting>
<section xml:id="_prefixed_fields">
<title>Prefixed fields</title>
<simpara>If they follow a common pattern, you can also prefix fields.
The following example shows how to propagate <literal>x-vcap-request-id</literal> the field as-is but send the <literal>country-code</literal> and <literal>user-id</literal> fields on the wire as <literal>x-baggage-country-code</literal> and <literal>x-baggage-user-id</literal>, respectively:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">tracingBuilder.propagationFactory(
  ExtraFieldPropagation.newFactoryBuilder(B3Propagation.FACTORY)
                       .addField("x-vcap-request-id")
                       .addPrefixedFields("baggage-", Arrays.asList("country-code", "user-id"))
                       .build()
);</programlisting>
<simpara>Later, you can call the following code to affect the country code of the current trace context:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">ExtraFieldPropagation.set("country-code", "FO");
String countryCode = ExtraFieldPropagation.get("country-code");</programlisting>
<simpara>Alternatively, if you have a reference to a trace context, you can use it explicitly, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">ExtraFieldPropagation.set(span.context(), "country-code", "FO");
String countryCode = ExtraFieldPropagation.get(span.context(), "country-code");</programlisting>
<important>
<simpara>A difference from previous versions of Sleuth is that, with Brave, you must pass the list of baggage keys.
There are two properties to achieve this.
With the <literal>spring.sleuth.baggage-keys</literal>, you set keys that get prefixed with <literal>baggage-</literal> for HTTP calls and <literal>baggage_</literal> for messaging.
You can also use the <literal>spring.sleuth.propagation-keys</literal> property to pass a list of prefixed keys that are whitelisted without any prefix.</simpara>
</important>

<section xml:id="_extracting_a_propagated_context">
<title>Extracting a Propagated Context</title>
<simpara>The <literal>TraceContext.Extractor&lt;C&gt;</literal> reads trace identifiers and sampling status from an incoming request or message.
The carrier is usually a request object or headers.</simpara>
<simpara>This utility is used in standard instrumentation (such as <literal>[HttpServerHandler](../instrumentation/http/src/main/java/sleuth/http/HttpServerHandler.java)</literal>) but can also be used for custom RPC or messaging code.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>TraceContextOrSamplingFlags</literal> is usually used only with <literal>Tracer.nextSpan(extracted)</literal>, unless you are
sharing span IDs between a client and a server.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_sharing_span_ids_between_client_and_server">
<title>Sharing span IDs between Client and Server</title>
<simpara>A normal instrumentation pattern is to create a span representing the server side of an RPC.
<literal>Extractor.extract</literal> might return a complete trace context when applied to an incoming client request.
<literal>Tracer.joinSpan</literal> attempts to continue this trace, using the same span ID if supported or creating a child span
if not. When the span ID is shared, the reported data includes a flag saying so.</simpara>

<simpara>Some propagation systems forward only the parent span ID, detected when <literal>Propagation.Factory.supportsJoin() == false</literal>.
In this case, a new span ID is always provisioned, and the incoming context determines the parent ID.</simpara>

<simpara>Note: Some span reporters do not support sharing span IDs.
For example, if you set <literal>Tracing.Builder.spanReporter(amazonXrayOrGoogleStackdrive)</literal>, you should disable join by setting <literal>Tracing.Builder.supportsJoin(false)</literal>.
Doing so forces a new child span on <literal>Tracer.joinSpan()</literal>.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_implementing_propagation">
<title>Implementing Propagation</title>
<simpara><literal>TraceContext.Extractor&lt;C&gt;</literal> is implemented by a <literal>Propagation.Factory</literal> plugin.
Internally, this code creates the union type, <literal>TraceContextOrSamplingFlags</literal>, with one of the following:
* <literal>TraceContext</literal> if trace and span IDs were present.
* <literal>TraceIdContext</literal> if a trace ID was present but span IDs were not present.
* <literal>SamplingFlags</literal> if no identifiers were present.</simpara>
<simpara>Some <literal>Propagation</literal> implementations carry extra data from the point of extraction (for example, reading incoming headers) to injection (for example, writing outgoing headers).
For example, it might carry a request ID.
When implementations have extra data, they handle it as follows:
* If a <literal>TraceContext</literal> were extracted, add the extra data as <literal>TraceContext.extra()</literal>.
* Otherwise, add it as <literal>TraceContextOrSamplingFlags.extra()</literal>, which <literal>Tracer.nextSpan</literal> handles.</simpara>

<title>Current Tracing Component</title>
<simpara>Brave supports a &#8220;current tracing component&#8221; concept, which should only be used when you have no other way to get a reference.
This was made for JDBC connections, as they often initialize prior to the tracing component.</simpara>
<simpara>The most recent tracing component instantiated is available through <literal>Tracing.current()</literal>.
You can also use <literal>Tracing.currentTracer()</literal> to get only the tracer.
If you use either of these methods, do not cache the result.

<title>Current Span</title>
<simpara>Brave supports a &#8220;current span&#8221; concept which represents the in-flight operation.

<section xml:id="_setting_a_span_in_scope_manually">
<title>Setting a span in scope manually</title>
<simpara>When writing new instrumentation, it is important to place a span you created in scope as the current span.
Not only does doing so let users access it with <literal>Tracer.currentSpan()</literal>, but it also allows customizations such as SLF4J MDC to see the current trace IDs.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>Tracer.withSpanInScope(Span)</literal> facilitates this and is most conveniently employed by using the try-with-resources idiom.
Whenever external code might be invoked (such as proceeding an interceptor or otherwise), place the span in scope, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">try (SpanInScope ws = tracer.withSpanInScope(span)) {
  return inboundRequest.invoke();
} finally { // note the scope is independent of the span
  span.finish();
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In edge cases, you may need to clear the current span temporarily (for example, launching a task that should not be associated with the current request). To do tso, pass null to <literal>withSpanInScope</literal>, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">try (SpanInScope cleared = tracer.withSpanInScope(null)) {
  startBackgroundThread();

<simpara>You can customize the keys used in span tags.
To limit the volume of span data, an HTTP request is, by default, tagged only with a handful of metadata, such as the status code, the host, and the URL.

<title>Managing Spans with Annotations</title>
<simpara>You can manage spans with a variety of annotations.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_rationale">
<title>Rationale</title>
<simpara>There are a number of good reasons to manage spans with annotations, including:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>API-agnostic means to collaborate with a span. Use of annotations lets users add to a span with no library dependency on a span api.
Doing so lets Sleuth change its core API to create less impact to user code.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Reduced surface area for basic span operations. Without this feature, you must use the span api, which has lifecycle commands that could be used incorrectly.
By only exposing scope, tag, and log functionality, you can collaborate without accidentally breaking span lifecycle.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Collaboration with runtime generated code. With libraries such as Spring Data and Feign, the implementations of interfaces are generated at runtime.
Consequently, span wrapping of objects was tedious.
Now you can provide annotations over interfaces and the arguments of those interfaces.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>
<section xml:id="_creating_new_spans">
<title>Creating New Spans</title>
<simpara>If you do not want to create local spans manually, you can use the <literal>@NewSpan</literal> annotation.
Also, we provide the <literal>@SpanTag</literal> annotation to add tags in an automated fashion.</simpara>
<simpara>Now we can consider some examples of usage.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@NewSpan
void testMethod();</programlisting>
<simpara>Annotating the method without any parameter leads to creating a new span whose name equals the annotated method name.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@NewSpan("customNameOnTestMethod4")
void testMethod4();</programlisting>
<simpara>If you provide the value in the annotation (either directly or by setting the <literal>name</literal> parameter), the created span has the provided value as the name.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// method declaration
@NewSpan(name = "customNameOnTestMethod5")
void testMethod5(@SpanTag("testTag") String param);

// and method execution
this.testBean.testMethod5("test");</programlisting>
<simpara>You can combine both the name and a tag. Let&#8217;s focus on the latter.
In this case, the value of the annotated method&#8217;s parameter runtime value becomes the value of the tag.
In our sample, the tag key is <literal>testTag</literal>, and the tag value is <literal>test</literal>.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@NewSpan(name = "customNameOnTestMethod3")
@Override
public void testMethod3() {
}</programlisting>
<simpara>You can place the <literal>@NewSpan</literal> annotation on both the class and an interface.
If you override the interface&#8217;s method and provide a different value for the <literal>@NewSpan</literal> annotation, the most
concrete one wins (in this case <literal>customNameOnTestMethod3</literal> is set).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_continuing_spans">
<title>Continuing Spans</title>
<simpara>If you want to add tags and annotations to an existing span, you can use the <literal>@ContinueSpan</literal> annotation, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// method declaration
@ContinueSpan(log = "testMethod11")
void testMethod11(@SpanTag("testTag11") String param);

// method execution
this.testBean.testMethod11("test");
this.testBean.testMethod13();</programlisting>

<simpara>If a customization of client / server parsing of the HTTP related spans is required,
just register a bean of type <literal>brave.http.HttpClientParser</literal> or

register a bean of type <literal>brave.http.HttpSampler</literal> and name the bean
 <literal>sleuthClientSampler</literal> for client sampler and <literal>sleuthServerSampler</literal> for server sampler.
 For your convenience the <literal>@ClientSampler</literal> and <literal>@ServerSampler</literal>

<section xml:id="_custom_service_name">
<title>Custom service name</title>
<simpara>By default, Sleuth assumes that, when you send a span to Zipkin, you want the span&#8217;s service name to be equal to the value of the <literal>spring.application.name</literal> property.
That is not always the case, though.
There are situations in which you want to explicitly provide a different service name for all spans coming from your application.
To achieve that, you can pass the following property to your application to override that value (the example is for a service named <literal>myService</literal>):</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.zipkin.service.name: myService</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_customization_of_reported_spans">
<title>Customization of Reported Spans</title>
<simpara>Before reporting spans (for example, to Zipkin) you may want to modify that span in some way.
You can do so by using the <literal>SpanAdjuster</literal> interface.</simpara>
<simpara>In Sleuth, we generat spans with a fixed name.
Some users want to modify the name depending on values of tags.
You can implement the <literal>SpanAdjuster</literal> interface to alter that name.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows how to register two beans that implement <literal>SpanAdjuster</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean SpanAdjuster adjusterOne() {
	return span -&gt; span.toBuilder().name("foo").build();
}

@Bean SpanAdjuster adjusterTwo() {
	return span -&gt; span.toBuilder().name(span.name() + " bar").build();

<simpara>To define the host that corresponds to a particular span, we need to resolve the host name and port.
The default approach is to take these values from server properties.
If those are not set, we try to retrieve the host name from the network interfaces.</simpara>
<simpara>If you have the discovery client enabled and prefer to retrieve the host address from the registered instance in a service registry, you have to set the <literal>spring.zipkin.locator.discovery.enabled</literal> property (it is applicable for both HTTP-based and Stream-based span reporting), as follows:</simpara>

<simpara>By default, if you add <literal>spring-cloud-starter-zipkin</literal> as a dependency to your project, when the span is closed, it is sent to Zipkin over HTTP.
The communication is asynchronous.
You can configure the URL by setting the <literal>spring.zipkin.baseUrl</literal> property, as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.zipkin.baseUrl: http://192.168.99.100:9411/</programlisting>
<simpara>If you want to find Zipkin through service discovery, you can pass the Zipkin&#8217;s service ID inside the URL, as shown in the following example for <literal>zipkinserver</literal> service ID:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.zipkin.baseUrl: http://zipkinserver/</programlisting>
<simpara>If you have web, rabbit, or kafka together on the classpath, you might need to pick the means by which you would like to send spans to zipkin.

<chapter xml:id="spring-cloud-consul-agent">
<title>Consul Agent</title>
<simpara>A Consul Agent client must be available to all Spring Cloud Consul applications.  By default, the Agent client is expected to be at <literal>localhost:8500</literal>.  See the <link xl:href="https://consul.io/docs/agent/basics.html">Agent documentation</link> for specifics on how to start an Agent client and how to connect to a cluster of Consul Agent Servers.  For development, after you have installed consul, you may start a Consul Agent using the following command:</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="spring-cloud-consul-discovery">
<title>Service Discovery with Consul</title>
<simpara>Service Discovery is one of the key tenets of a microservice based architecture. Trying to hand configure each client or some form of convention can be very difficult to do and can be very brittle.  Consul provides Service Discovery services via an <link xl:href="https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/http.html">HTTP API</link> and <link xl:href="https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/dns.html">DNS</link>.  Spring Cloud Consul leverages the HTTP API for service registration and discovery.  This does not prevent non-Spring Cloud applications from leveraging the DNS interface.  Consul Agents servers are run in a <link xl:href="https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/architecture.html">cluster</link> that communicates via a <link xl:href="https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/gossip.html">gossip protocol</link> and uses the <link xl:href="https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/consensus.html">Raft consensus protocol</link>.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_how_to_activate">
<title>How to activate</title>
<simpara>To activate Consul Service Discovery use the starter with group <literal>org.springframework.cloud</literal> and artifact id <literal>spring-cloud-starter-consul-discovery</literal>.

</section>
<section xml:id="_registering_with_consul">
<title>Registering with Consul</title>
<simpara>When a client registers with Consul, it provides meta-data about itself such as host and port, id, name and tags.  An HTTP <link xl:href="https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/checks.html">Check</link> is created by default that Consul hits the <literal>/health</literal> endpoint every 10 seconds.  If the health check fails, the service instance is marked as critical.</simpara>
<simpara>Example Consul client:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class Application {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home() {
        return "Hello world";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new SpringApplicationBuilder(Application.class).web(true).run(args);
    }

}</programlisting>
<simpara>(i.e. utterly normal Spring Boot app).  If the Consul client is located somewhere other than <literal>localhost:8500</literal>, the configuration is required to locate the client. Example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>spring:
  cloud:
    consul:
      host: localhost
      port: 8500</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<caution>
<simpara>If you use <link linkend="spring-cloud-consul-config">Spring Cloud Consul Config</link>, the above values will need to be placed in <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal> instead of <literal>application.yml</literal>.</simpara>
</caution>
<simpara>The default service name, instance id and port, taken from the <literal>Environment</literal>, are <literal>${spring.application.name}</literal>, the Spring Context ID and <literal>${server.port}</literal> respectively.</simpara>
<simpara>To disable the Consul Discovery Client you can set <literal>spring.cloud.consul.discovery.enabled</literal> to <literal>false</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To disable the service registration you can set <literal>spring.cloud.consul.discovery.register</literal> to <literal>false</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_http_health_check">
<title>HTTP Health Check</title>
<simpara>The health check for a Consul instance defaults to "/health", which is the default locations of a useful endpoint in a Spring Boot Actuator application. You need to change these, even for an Actuator application if you use a non-default context path or servlet path (e.g. <literal>server.servletPath=/foo</literal>) or management endpoint path (e.g. <literal>management.context-path=/admin</literal>). The interval that Consul uses to check the health endpoint may also be configured.  "10s" and "1m" represent 10 seconds and 1 minute respectively.  Example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>spring:
  cloud:
    consul:
      discovery:
        healthCheckPath: ${management.context-path}/health
        healthCheckInterval: 15s</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<section xml:id="_metadata_and_consul_tags">
<title>Metadata and Consul tags</title>
<simpara>Consul does not yet support metadata on services. Spring Cloud&#8217;s <literal>ServiceInstance</literal> has a <literal>Map&lt;String, String&gt; metadata</literal> field. Spring Cloud Consul uses Consul tags to approximate metadata until Consul officially supports metadata. Tags with the form <literal>key=value</literal> will be split and used as a <literal>Map</literal> key and value respectively. Tags without the equal <literal>=</literal> sign, will be used as both the key and value.</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>spring:
  cloud:
    consul:
      discovery:
        tags: foo=bar, baz</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>The above configuration will result in a map with <literal>foo&#8594;bar</literal> and <literal>baz&#8594;baz</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_making_the_consul_instance_id_unique">
<title>Making the Consul Instance ID Unique</title>
<simpara>By default a consul instance is registered with an ID that is equal to its Spring Application Context ID. By default, the Spring Application Context ID is <literal>${spring.application.name}:comma,separated,profiles:${server.port}</literal>. For most cases, this will allow multiple instances of one service to run on one machine.  If further uniqueness is required, Using Spring Cloud you can override this by providing a unique identifier in <literal>spring.cloud.consul.discovery.instanceId</literal>. For example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>spring:
  cloud:
    consul:
      discovery:
        instanceId: ${spring.application.name}:${vcap.application.instance_id:${spring.application.instance_id:${random.value}}}</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>With this metadata, and multiple service instances deployed on localhost, the random value will kick in there to make the instance unique. In Cloudfoundry the <literal>vcap.application.instance_id</literal> will be populated automatically in a Spring Boot application, so the random value will not be needed.</simpara>

Both Feign and the discovery-aware RestTemplate utilize <link xl:href="http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/single/spring-cloud-netflix.html#spring-cloud-ribbon">Ribbon</link> for client-side load balancing.</simpara>
<simpara>If you want to access service STORES using the RestTemplate simply declare:</simpara>
<screen>@LoadBalanced
@Bean

<simpara>If you have Consul clusters in multiple datacenters and you want to access a service in another datacenter a service name/id alone is not enough. In that case
you use property <literal>spring.cloud.consul.discovery.datacenters.STORES=dc-west</literal> where <literal>STORES</literal> is the service name/id and <literal>dc-west</literal> is the datacenter

<title>Distributed Configuration with Consul</title>
<simpara>Consul provides a <link xl:href="https://consul.io/docs/agent/http/kv.html">Key/Value Store</link> for storing configuration and other metadata.  Spring Cloud Consul Config is an alternative to the <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config">Config Server and Client</link>.  Configuration is loaded into the Spring Environment during the special "bootstrap" phase.  Configuration is stored in the <literal>/config</literal> folder by default.  Multiple <literal>PropertySource</literal> instances are created based on the application&#8217;s name and the active profiles that mimicks the Spring Cloud Config order of resolving properties.  For example, an application with the name "testApp" and with the "dev" profile will have the following property sources created:</simpara>
<screen>config/testApp,dev/
config/testApp/
config/application,dev/
config/application/</screen>
<simpara>The most specific property source is at the top, with the least specific at the bottom.  Properties in the <literal>config/application</literal> folder are applicable to all applications using consul for configuration.  Properties in the <literal>config/testApp</literal> folder are only available to the instances of the service named "testApp".</simpara>
<simpara>Configuration is currently read on startup of the application.  Sending a HTTP POST to <literal>/refresh</literal> will cause the configuration to be reloaded. <xref linkend="spring-cloud-consul-config-watch"/> will also automatically detect changes and reload the application context.</simpara>

<title>Service Discovery with Zookeeper</title>
<simpara>Service Discovery is one of the key tenets of a microservice based architecture. Trying to
hand-configure each client or some form of convention can be difficult to do and can be
brittle. <link xl:href="http://curator.apache.org">Curator</link>(A Java library for Zookeeper) provides Service
Discovery through a <link xl:href="http://curator.apache.org/curator-x-discovery/">Service Discovery
Extension</link>. Spring Cloud Zookeeper uses this extension for service registration and
discovery.</simpara>

<simpara>Including a dependency on
<literal>org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-zookeeper-discovery</literal> enables

<section xml:id="_registering_with_zookeeper">
<title>Registering with Zookeeper</title>
<simpara>When a client registers with Zookeeper, it provides metadata (such as host and port, ID,
and name) about itself.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows a Zookeeper client:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class Application {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home() {
        return "Hello world";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new SpringApplicationBuilder(Application.class).web(true).run(args);
    }

}</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>The preceding example is a normal Spring Boot application.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>If Zookeeper is located somewhere other than <literal>localhost:2181</literal>, the configuration must
provide the location of the server, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    zookeeper:
      connect-string: localhost:2181</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<caution>
<simpara>If you use <link linkend="spring-cloud-zookeeper-config">Spring Cloud Zookeeper Config</link>, the
values shown in the preceding example need to be in <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal> instead of
<literal>application.yml</literal>.</simpara>
</caution>
<simpara>The default service name, instance ID, and port (taken from the <literal>Environment</literal>) are
<literal>${spring.application.name}</literal>, the Spring Context ID, and <literal>${server.port}</literal>, respectively.</simpara>
<simpara>Having <literal>spring-cloud-starter-zookeeper-discovery</literal> on the classpath makes the app into both
a Zookeeper &#8220;service&#8221; (that is, it registers itself) and a &#8220;client&#8221; (that is, it can
query Zookeeper to locate other services).</simpara>
<simpara>If you would like to disable the Zookeeper Discovery Client, you can set
<literal>spring.cloud.zookeeper.discovery.enabled</literal> to <literal>false</literal>.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_instance_status">
<title>Instance Status</title>
<simpara>Netflix Eureka supports having instances that are <literal>OUT_OF_SERVICE</literal> registered with the
server. These instances are not returned as active service instances. This is useful for
behaviors such as blue/green deployments. (Note that the Curator Service Discovery recipe
does not  support this behavior.) Taking advantage of the flexible payload has let Spring
Cloud Zookeeper implement <literal>OUT_OF_SERVICE</literal> by updating some specific metadata and then
filtering on that metadata in the Ribbon <literal>ZookeeperServerList</literal>. The <literal>ZookeeperServerList</literal>
filters out all non-null instance statuses that do not equal <literal>UP</literal>. If the instance status
field is empty, it is considered to be <literal>UP</literal> for backwards compatibility. To change the
status of an instance, make a <literal>POST</literal> with <literal>OUT_OF_SERVICE</literal> to the <literal>ServiceRegistry</literal>
instance status actuator endpoint, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="sh" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ http POST http://localhost:8081/service-registry status=OUT_OF_SERVICE</programlisting>

<section xml:id="spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependencies-using">
<title>Using the Zookeeper Dependencies</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Zookeeper gives you a possibility to provide dependencies of your application
as properties. As dependencies, you can understand other applications that are registered
in Zookeeper and which you would like to call through
<link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-cloud-netflix.adoc#spring-cloud-feign">Feign</link>

<simpara>You can also use the Zookeeper Dependency Watchers functionality to control and monitor
the state of your dependencies.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependencies-activating">
<title>Activating Zookeeper Dependencies</title>
<simpara>Including a dependency on
<literal>org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-zookeeper-discovery</literal> enables
autoconfiguration that sets up Spring Cloud Zookeeper Dependencies. Even if you provide
the dependencies in your properties, you can turn off the dependencies. To do so, set the
<literal>spring.cloud.zookeeper.dependency.enabled</literal> property to false (it defaults to <literal>true</literal>).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependencies-setting-up">
<title>Setting up Zookeeper Dependencies</title>
<simpara>Consider the following example of dependency representation:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.application.name: yourServiceName
spring.cloud.zookeeper:
  dependencies:
    newsletter:
      path: /path/where/newsletter/has/registered/in/zookeeper
      loadBalancerType: ROUND_ROBIN
      contentTypeTemplate: application/vnd.newsletter.$version+json
      version: v1
      headers:

            - value1
        header2:

      loadBalancerType: ROUND_ROBIN
      contentTypeTemplate: application/vnd.mailing.$version+json
      version: v1
      required: true</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>The next few sections go through each part of the dependency one by one. The root property
name is <literal>spring.cloud.zookeeper.dependencies</literal>.</simpara>
<section xml:id="spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependencies-setting-up-aliases">
<title>Aliases</title>
<simpara>Below the root property you have to represent each dependency as an alias. This is due to
the constraints of Ribbon, which requires that the application ID be placed in the URL.
Consequently, you cannot pass any complex path, suchas  <literal>/myApp/myRoute/name</literal>). The alias
is the name you use instead of the <literal>serviceId</literal> for <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal>, <literal>Feign</literal>, or
<literal>RestTemplate</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>In the previous examples, the aliases are <literal>newsletter</literal> and <literal>mailing</literal>. The following
example shows Feign usage with a <literal>newsletter</literal> alias:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@FeignClient("newsletter")
public interface NewsletterService {
        @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value = "/newsletter")
        String getNewsletters();
}</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_path">
<title>Path</title>
<simpara>The path is represented by the <literal>path</literal> YAML property and is the path under which the
dependency is registered under Zookeeper. As described in the
<link linkend="spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependencies-setting-up-aliases">previous section</link>, Ribbon
operates on URLs. As a result, this path is not compliant with its requirement.
That is why Spring Cloud Zookeeper maps the alias to the proper path.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_load_balancer_type">
<title>Load Balancer Type</title>
<simpara>The load balancer type is represented by <literal>loadBalancerType</literal> YAML property.</simpara>
<simpara>If you know what kind of load-balancing strategy has to be applied when calling this
particular dependency, you can provide it in the YAML file, and it is automatically
applied. You can choose one of the following load balancing strategies:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>STICKY: Once chosen, the instance is always called.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>RANDOM: Picks an instance randomly.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>ROUND_ROBIN: Iterates over instances over and over again.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>
<section xml:id="__literal_content_type_literal_template_and_version">
<title><literal>Content-Type</literal> Template and Version</title>
<simpara>The <literal>Content-Type</literal> template and version are represented by the <literal>contentTypeTemplate</literal> and
<literal>version</literal> YAML properties.</simpara>
<simpara>If you version your API in the <literal>Content-Type</literal> header, you do not want to add this header
to each of your requests. Also, if you want to call a new version of the API, you do not
want to roam around your code to bump up the API version. That is why you can provide a
<literal>contentTypeTemplate</literal> with a special <literal>$version</literal> placeholder. That placeholder will be filled by the value of the
<literal>version</literal> YAML property. Consider the following example of a <literal>contentTypeTemplate</literal>:</simpara>
<screen>application/vnd.newsletter.$version+json</screen>
<simpara>Further consider the following <literal>version</literal>:</simpara>
<screen>v1</screen>
<simpara>The combination of <literal>contentTypeTemplate</literal> and version results in the creation of a
<literal>Content-Type</literal> header for each request, as follows:</simpara>
<screen>application/vnd.newsletter.v1+json</screen>
</section>
<section xml:id="_default_headers">
<title>Default Headers</title>
<simpara>Default headers are represented by the <literal>headers</literal> map in YAML.</simpara>
<simpara>Sometimes, each call to a dependency requires setting up of some default headers. To not
do that in code, you can set them up in the YAML file, as shown in the following example
<literal>headers</literal> section:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yml" linenumbering="unnumbered">headers:
    Accept:
        - text/html
        - application/xhtml+xml
    Cache-Control:
        - no-cache</programlisting>
<simpara>That <literal>headers</literal> section results in adding the <literal>Accept</literal> and <literal>Cache-Control</literal> headers with
appropriate list of values in your HTTP request.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_required_dependencies">
<title>Required Dependencies</title>
<simpara>Required dependencies are represented by <literal>required</literal> property in YAML.</simpara>
<simpara>If one of your dependencies is required to be up when your application boots, you can set
the <literal>required: true</literal> property in the YAML file.</simpara>
<simpara>If your application cannot localize the required dependency during boot time, it throws an
exception, and the Spring Context fails to set up. In other words, your application cannot
start if the required dependency is not registered in Zookeeper.</simpara>
<simpara>You can read more about Spring Cloud Zookeeper Presence Checker
<link linkend="spring-cloud-zookeeper-dependency-watcher-presence-checker">later in this document</link>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_stubs">
<title>Stubs</title>
<simpara>You can provide a colon-separated path to the JAR containing stubs of the dependency, as
shown in the following example:</simpara>
<simpara><literal>stubs: org.springframework:myApp:stubs</literal></simpara>
<simpara>where:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>org.springframework</literal> is the <literal>groupId</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>myApp</literal> is the <literal>artifactId</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>stubs</literal> is the classifier. (Note that <literal>stubs</literal> is the default value.)</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Because <literal>stubs</literal> is the default classifier, the preceding example is equal to the following
example:</simpara>
<simpara><literal>stubs: org.springframework:myApp</literal></simpara>

<chapter xml:id="spring-cloud-zookeeper-config">
<title>Distributed Configuration with Zookeeper</title>
<simpara>Zookeeper provides a
<link xl:href="http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperOver.html#sc_dataModelNameSpace">hierarchical namespace</link>
that lets clients store arbitrary data, such as configuration data. Spring Cloud Zookeeper
Config is an alternative to the
<link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config">Config Server and Client</link>.
Configuration is loaded into the Spring Environment during the special &#8220;bootstrap&#8221;
phase. Configuration is stored in the <literal>/config</literal> namespace by default. Multiple
<literal>PropertySource</literal> instances are created, based on the application&#8217;s name and the active
profiles, to mimic the Spring Cloud Config order of resolving properties. For example, an
application with a name of <literal>testApp</literal> and with the <literal>dev</literal> profile has the following property
sources created for it:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>config/testApp,dev</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>config/testApp</literal></simpara>

<simpara><literal>config/application,dev</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>config/application</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The most specific property source is at the top, with the least specific at the bottom.
Properties in the <literal>config/application</literal> namespace apply to all applications that use
zookeeper for configuration. Properties in the <literal>config/testApp</literal> namespace are available
only to the instances of the service named <literal>testApp</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Configuration is currently read on startup of the application. Sending a HTTP <literal>POST</literal>

namespace (which Zookeeper supports) is not currently implemented.</simpara>

to see how the <literal>CuratorFramework</literal> bean&#8217;s default configuration.</simpara>
<simpara>Alternatively, you can add your credentials from a class that depends on the existing

public class DefaultCuratorFrameworkConfig {

  public ZookeeperConfig(CuratorFramework curator) {

}</programlisting>
<simpara>The creation of this bean must occur during the boostrapping phase. You can register
configuration classes to run during this phase by annotating them with
<literal>@BootstrapConfiguration</literal> and including them in a comma-separated list that you set as the
value of the <literal>org.springframework.cloud.bootstrap.BootstrapConfiguration</literal> property in the

<title>Spring Cloud Security</title>
<partintro>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Security offers a set of primitives for building secure
applications and services with minimum fuss. A declarative model which
can be heavily configured externally (or centrally) lends itself to
the implementation of large systems of co-operating, remote components,
usually with a central indentity management service. It is also extremely
easy to use in a service platform like Cloud Foundry. Building on
Spring Boot and Spring Security OAuth2 we can quickly create systems that
implement common patterns like single sign on, token relay and token
exchange.</simpara>

<simpara>You can run it with <literal>spring run app.groovy</literal> and watch the logs for the password (username is "user"). So far this is just the default for a Spring Boot app.</simpara>
<simpara>Here&#8217;s a Spring Cloud app with OAuth2 SSO:</simpara>

</formalpara>
<simpara>Spot the difference? This app will actually behave exactly the same as
the previous one, because it doesn&#8217;t know it&#8217;s OAuth2 credentals
yet.</simpara>
<simpara>You can register an app in github quite easily, so try that if you
want a production app on your own domain. If you are happy to test on
localhost:8080, then set up these properties in your application
configuration:</simpara>
<formalpara>

</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>run the app above and it will redirect to github for authorization. If
you are already signed into github you won&#8217;t even notice that it has
authenticated.  These credentials will only work if your app is
running on port 8080.</simpara>
<simpara>To limit the scope that the client asks for when it obtains an access token
you can set <literal>security.oauth2.client.scope</literal> (comma separated or an array in YAML). By
default the scope is empty and it is up to to Authorization Server to
decide what the defaults should be, usually depending on the settings in
the client registration that it holds.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The examples above are all Groovy scripts. If you want to write the
same code in Java (or Groovy) you need to add Spring Security OAuth2
to the classpath (e.g. see the

<section xml:id="_token_relay">
<title>Token Relay</title>
<simpara>A Token Relay is where an OAuth2 consumer acts as a Client and
forwards the incoming token to outgoing resource requests. The
consumer can be a pure Client (like an SSO application) or a Resource
Server.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_client_token_relay">
<title>Client Token Relay</title>
<simpara>If your app is a user facing OAuth2 client (i.e. has declared
<literal>@EnableOAuth2Sso</literal> or <literal>@EnableOAuth2Client</literal>) then it has an
<literal>OAuth2ClientContext</literal> in request scope from Spring Boot. You can
create your own <literal>OAuth2RestTemplate</literal> from this context and an
autowired <literal>OAuth2ProtectedResourceDetails</literal>, and then the context will
always forward the access token downstream, also refreshing the access
token automatically if it expires. (These are features of Spring
Security and Spring Boot.)</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Spring Boot (1.4.1) does not create an
<literal>OAuth2ProtectedResourceDetails</literal> automatically if you are using
<literal>client_credentials</literal> tokens. In that case you need to create your own
<literal>ClientCredentialsResourceDetails</literal> and configure it with
<literal>@ConfigurationProperties("security.oauth2.client")</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_client_token_relay_in_zuul_proxy">
<title>Client Token Relay in Zuul Proxy</title>
<simpara>If your app also has a
<link xl:href="http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud.html#netflix-zuul-reverse-proxy">Spring
Cloud Zuul</link> embedded reverse proxy (using <literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal>) then you
can ask it to forward OAuth2 access tokens downstream to the services
it is proxying. Thus the SSO app above can be enhanced simply like
this:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>app.groovy</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Controller
@EnableOAuth2Sso
@EnableZuulProxy
class Application {

}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>and it will (in addition to logging the user in and grabbing a token)
pass the authentication token downstream to the <literal>/proxy/*</literal>
services. If those services are implemented with
<literal>@EnableResourceServer</literal> then they will get a valid token in the
correct header.</simpara>
<simpara>How does it work? The <literal>@EnableOAuth2Sso</literal> annotation pulls in
<literal>spring-cloud-starter-security</literal> (which you could do manually in a
traditional app), and that in turn triggers some autoconfiguration for
a <literal>ZuulFilter</literal>, which itself is activated because Zuul is on the
classpath (via <literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal>). The
<link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-security/tree/master/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/security/oauth2/proxy/OAuth2TokenRelayFilter.java">filter</link>
just extracts an access token from the currently authenticated user,
and puts it in a request header for the downstream requests.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_resource_server_token_relay">
<title>Resource Server Token Relay</title>
<simpara>If your app has <literal>@EnableResourceServer</literal> you might want to relay the
incoming token downstream to other services. If you use a
<literal>RestTemplate</literal> to contact the downstream services then this is just a
matter of how to create the template with the right context.</simpara>
<simpara>If your service uses <literal>UserInfoTokenServices</literal> to authenticate incoming
tokens (i.e. it is using the <literal>security.oauth2.user-info-uri</literal>
configuration), then you can simply create an <literal>OAuth2RestTemplate</literal>
using an autowired <literal>OAuth2ClientContext</literal> (it will be populated by the
authentication process before it hits the backend code). Equivalently
(with Spring Boot 1.4), you could inject a
<literal>UserInfoRestTemplateFactory</literal> and grab its <literal>OAuth2RestTemplate</literal> in
your configuration. For example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>MyConfiguration.java</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public OAuth2RestTemplate restTemplate(UserInfoRestTemplateFactory factory) {
    return factory.getUserInfoRestTemplate();
}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>This rest template will then have the same <literal>OAuth2ClientContext</literal>
(request-scoped) that is used by the authentication filter, so you can
use it to send requests with the same access token.</simpara>
<simpara>If your app is not using <literal>UserInfoTokenServices</literal> but is still a client
(i.e. it declares <literal>@EnableOAuth2Client</literal> or <literal>@EnableOAuth2Sso</literal>), then
with Spring Security Cloud any <literal>OAuth2RestOperations</literal> that the user
creates from an <literal>@Autowired</literal> <literal>@OAuth2Context</literal> will also forward
tokens. This feature is implemented by default as an MVC handler
interceptor, so it only works in Spring MVC. If you are not using MVC
you could use a custom filter or AOP interceptor wrapping an
<literal>AccessTokenContextRelay</literal> to provide the same feature.</simpara>
<simpara>Here&#8217;s a basic
example showing the use of an autowired rest template created
elsewhere ("foo.com" is a Resource Server accepting the same tokens as
the surrounding app):</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>MyController.java</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowired
private OAuth2RestOperations restTemplate;

@RequestMapping("/relay")
public String relay() {
    ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; response =
      restTemplate.getForEntity("https://foo.com/bar", String.class);
    return "Success! (" + response.getBody() + ")";
}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>If you don&#8217;t want to forward tokens (and that is a valid
choice, since you might want to act as yourself, rather than the
client that sent you the token), then you only need to create your own
<literal>OAuth2Context</literal> instead of autowiring the default one.</simpara>
<simpara>Feign clients will also pick up an interceptor that uses the
<literal>OAuth2ClientContext</literal> if it is available, so they should also do a
token relay anywhere where a <literal>RestTemplate</literal> would.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_configuring_authentication_downstream_of_a_zuul_proxy">
<title>Configuring Authentication Downstream of a Zuul Proxy</title>
<simpara>You can control the authorization behaviour downstream of an
<literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal> through the <literal>proxy.auth.*</literal> settings. Example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">proxy:
  auth:

      customers: oauth2
      stores: passthru
      recommendations: none</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>In this example the "customers" service gets an OAuth2 token relay,
the "stores" service gets a passthrough (the authorization header is
just passed downstream), and the "recommendations" service has its
authorization header removed. The default behaviour is to do a token
relay if there is a token available, and passthru otherwise.</simpara>

<simpara>The main purposes of Spring Cloud Contract Verifier with Stub Runner are:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>To ensure that WireMock/Messaging stubs (used when developing the client) do exactly
what the actual server-side implementation does.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>To promote ATDD method and Microservices architectural style.</simpara>
</listitem>

<simpara>To provide a way to publish changes in contracts that are immediately visible on both

<important>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier&#8217;s purpose is NOT to start writing business
features in the contracts. Assume that we have a business use case of fraud check. If a
user can be a fraud for 100 different reasons, we would assume that you would create 2
contracts, one for the positive case and one for the negative case. Contract tests are
used to test contracts between applications and not to simulate full behavior.</simpara>

<section xml:id="spring-cloud-contract-verifier-intro-three-second-tour-producer">
<title>On the Producer Side</title>
<simpara>To start working with Spring Cloud Contract, add files with <literal>REST/</literal> messaging contracts
expressed in either Groovy DSL or YAML to the contracts directory, which is set by the
<literal>contractsDslDir</literal> property. By default, it is <literal>$rootDir/src/test/resources/contracts</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Then add the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier dependency and plugin to your build file, as
shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>The following listing shows how to add the plugin, which should go in the build/plugins
portion of the file:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;plugin&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;version&gt;${spring-cloud-contract.version}&lt;/version&gt;
	&lt;extensions&gt;true&lt;/extensions&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Running <literal>./mvnw clean install</literal> automatically generates tests that verify the application
compliance with the added contracts. By default, the tests get generated under
<literal>org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.tests.</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>As the implementation of the functionalities described by the contracts is not yet
present, the tests fail.</simpara>
<simpara>To make them pass, you must add the correct implementation of either handling HTTP
requests or messages. Also, you must add a correct base test class for auto-generated
tests to the project. This class is extended by all the auto-generated tests, and it
should contain all the setup necessary to run them (for example <literal>RestAssuredMockMvc</literal>
controller setup or messaging test setup).</simpara>
<simpara>Once the implementation and the test base class are in place, the tests pass, and both the
application and the stub artifacts are built and installed in the local Maven repository.
The changes can now be merged, and both the application and the stub artifacts may be
published in an online repository.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="spring-cloud-contract-verifier-intro-three-second-tour-consumer">
<title>On the Consumer Side</title>
<simpara><literal>Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner</literal> can be used in the integration tests to get a running
WireMock instance or messaging route that simulates the actual service.</simpara>
<simpara>To do so, add the dependency to <literal>Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner</literal>, as shown in the
following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-starter-contract-stub-runner&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>You can get the Producer-side stubs installed in your Maven repository in either of two
ways:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>By checking out the Producer side repository and adding contracts and generating the stubs
by running the following commands:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ cd local-http-server-repo
$ ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests</programlisting>
<tip>
<simpara>The tests are being skipped because the Producer-side contract implementation is not
in place yet, so the automatically-generated contract tests fail.</simpara>
</tip>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>By getting already-existing producer service stubs from a remote repository. To do so,
pass the stub artifact IDs and artifact repository URL as <literal>Spring Cloud Contract
Stub Runner</literal> properties, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">stubrunner:
  ids: 'com.example:http-server-dsl:+:stubs:8080'
  repositoryRoot: http://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot</programlisting>
</listitem>

<section xml:id="spring-cloud-contract-verifier-intro-three-minute-tour-producer">
<title>On the Producer Side</title>
<simpara>To start working with <literal>Spring Cloud Contract</literal>, add files with <literal>REST/</literal> messaging contracts
expressed in either Groovy DSL or YAML to the contracts directory, which is set by the
<literal>contractsDslDir</literal> property. By default, it is <literal>$rootDir/src/test/resources/contracts</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>For the HTTP stubs, a contract defines what kind of response should be returned for a
given request (taking into account the HTTP methods, URLs, headers, status codes, and so
on). The following example shows how an HTTP stub contract in Groovy DSL:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">package contracts

org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
	request {
		method 'PUT'
		url '/fraudcheck'
		body([
			   "client.id": $(regex('[0-9]{10}')),
			   loanAmount: 99999
		])
		headers {
			contentType('application/json')
		}
	}
	response {
		status OK()
		body([
			   fraudCheckStatus: "FRAUD",
			   "rejection.reason": "Amount too high"
		])
		headers {
			contentType('application/json')
		}
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The same contract expressed in YAML would look like the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">request:
  method: PUT
  url: /fraudcheck
  body:
    "client.id": 1234567890
    loanAmount: 99999
  headers:
    Content-Type: application/json
  matchers:
    body:
      - path: $.['client.id']
        type: by_regex
        value: "[0-9]{10}"
response:
  status: 200
  body:
    fraudCheckStatus: "FRAUD"
    "rejection.reason": "Amount too high"
  headers:
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8</programlisting>
<simpara>In the case of messaging, you can define:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>The input and the output messages can be defined (taking into account from and where it
was sent, the message body, and the header).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The methods that should be called after the message is received.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The methods that, when called, should trigger a message.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The following example shows a Camel messaging contract expressed in Groovy DSL:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">def contractDsl = Contract.make {
	label 'some_label'
	input {
		messageFrom('jms:delete')
		messageBody([
				bookName: 'foo'
		])
		messageHeaders {
			header('sample', 'header')
		}
		assertThat('bookWasDeleted()')
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The following example shows the same contract expressed in YAML:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yml" linenumbering="unnumbered">label: some_label
input:
  messageFrom: jms:delete
  messageBody:
    bookName: 'foo'
  messageHeaders:
    sample: header
  assertThat: bookWasDeleted()</programlisting>
<simpara>Then you can add Spring Cloud Contract Verifier dependency and plugin to your build file,
as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>The following listing shows how to add the plugin, which should go in the build/plugins
portion of the file:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;plugin&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;version&gt;${spring-cloud-contract.version}&lt;/version&gt;
	&lt;extensions&gt;true&lt;/extensions&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Running <literal>./mvnw clean install</literal> automatically generates tests that verify the application
compliance with the added contracts. By default, the generated tests are under
<literal>org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.tests.</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows a sample auto-generated test for an HTTP contract:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Test
public void validate_shouldMarkClientAsFraud() throws Exception {
    // given:
        MockMvcRequestSpecification request = given()
                .header("Content-Type", "application/vnd.fraud.v1+json")
                .body("{\"client.id\":\"1234567890\",\"loanAmount\":99999}");

    // when:
        ResponseOptions response = given().spec(request)
                .put("/fraudcheck");

    // then:
        assertThat(response.statusCode()).isEqualTo(200);
        assertThat(response.header("Content-Type")).matches("application/vnd.fraud.v1.json.*");
    // and:
        DocumentContext parsedJson = JsonPath.parse(response.getBody().asString());
        assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("['fraudCheckStatus']").matches("[A-Z]{5}");
        assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("['rejection.reason']").isEqualTo("Amount too high");
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The preceding example uses Spring&#8217;s <literal>MockMvc</literal> to run the tests. This is the default test
mode for HTTP contracts. However, JAX-RX client and explicit HTTP invocations can also be
used. (To do so, change the <literal>testMode</literal> property of the plugin to <literal>JAX-RS</literal> or <literal>EXPLICIT</literal>,
respectively.)</simpara>
<simpara>Apart from the default JUnit, you can instead use Spock tests, by setting the plugin
<literal>testFramework</literal> property to <literal>Spock</literal>.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>You can now also generate WireMock scenarios based on the contracts, by including an
order number followed by an underscore at the beginning of the contract file names.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>The following example shows an auto-generated test in Spock for a messaging stub contract:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">[source,groovy,indent=0]</literallayout>
<screen>given:
	 ContractVerifierMessage inputMessage = contractVerifierMessaging.create(
		\'\'\'{"bookName":"foo"}\'\'\',
		['sample': 'header']
	)

when:
	 contractVerifierMessaging.send(inputMessage, 'jms:delete')

then:
	 noExceptionThrown()
	 bookWasDeleted()</screen>
<simpara>As the implementation of the functionalities described by the contracts is not yet
present, the tests fail.</simpara>
<simpara>To make them pass, you must add the correct implementation of handling either HTTP
requests or messages. Also, you must add a correct base test class for auto-generated
tests to the project. This class is extended by all the auto-generated tests and should
contain all the setup necessary to run them (for example, <literal>RestAssuredMockMvc</literal> controller
setup or messaging test setup).</simpara>
<simpara>Once the implementation and the test base class are in place, the tests pass, and both the
application and the stub artifacts are built and installed in the local Maven repository.
Information about installing the stubs jar to the local repository appears in the logs, as
shown in the following example:</simpara>

<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Docker Project</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>In order to enable working with contracts while creating applications in non-JVM
technologies, the <literal>springcloud/spring-cloud-contract</literal> Docker image has been created. It
contains a project that automatically generates tests for HTTP contracts and executes them
in  <literal>EXPLICIT</literal> test mode. Then, if the tests pass, it generates Wiremock stubs and,
optionally, publishes them to an artifact manager. In order to use the image, you can
mount the contracts into the <literal>/contracts</literal> directory and set a few environment variables.</simpara>

<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Write the missing implementation.</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>At some point in time, you need to send a request to the Fraud Detection service. Assume

<simpara>Place the contract under <literal>src/test/resources/contracts/fraud</literal> folder. The <literal>fraud</literal> folder

<simpara>The YML contract is quite straight-forward. However when you take a look at the Contract
written using a statically typed Groovy DSL - you might wonder what the
<literal>value(client(&#8230;&#8203;), server(&#8230;&#8203;))</literal> parts are. By using this notation, Spring Cloud
Contract lets you define parts of a JSON block, a URL, etc., which are dynamic. In case
of an identifier or a timestamp, you need not hardcode a value. You want to allow some
different ranges of values. To enable ranges of values, you can set regular expressions
matching those values for the consumer side. You can provide the body by means of either
a map notation or String with interpolations.
<link xl:href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/single/spring-cloud-contract.html#_contract_dsl">Consult the docs
for more information.</link> We highly recommend using the map notation!</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>You must understand the map notation in order to set up contracts. Please read the
<link xl:href="http://groovy-lang.org/json.html">Groovy docs regarding JSON</link>.</simpara>

<simpara>The previously shown contract is an agreement between two sides that:</simpara>

<simpara>Once you are ready to check the API in practice in the integration tests, you need to

<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Add the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier plugin.</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>We can add either a Maven or a Gradle plugin. In this example, you see how to add Maven.
First, add the <literal>Spring Cloud Contract</literal> BOM.</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependencyManagement&gt;

			&lt;scope&gt;import&lt;/scope&gt;
		&lt;/dependency&gt;
	&lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Next, add the <literal>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier</literal> Maven plugin</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;plugin&gt;

<simpara>Since the plugin was added, you get the <literal>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier</literal> features which,

<simpara>You do not want to generate tests since you, as the consumer, want only to play with the

<simpara>This example uses "convention based" naming by setting the
<literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal> property. Doing so means that the two last packages combine to
make the name of the base test class. In our case, the contracts were placed under
<literal>src/test/resources/contracts/fraud</literal>. Since you do not have two packages starting from
the <literal>contracts</literal> folder, pick only one, which should be <literal>fraud</literal>. Add the <literal>Base</literal> suffix and
capitalize <literal>fraud</literal>. That gives you the <literal>FraudBase</literal> test class name.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>All the generated tests extend that class. Over there, you can set up your Spring Context

<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">Results :

Tests in error:
  ContractVerifierTest.validate_shouldMarkClientAsFraud:32 » IllegalState Parsed...</programlisting>
<simpara>This error occurs because you have a new contract from which a test was generated and it
failed since you have not implemented the feature. The auto-generated test would look
like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Test
public void validate_shouldMarkClientAsFraud() throws Exception {
    // given:
        MockMvcRequestSpecification request = given()
                .header("Content-Type", "application/vnd.fraud.v1+json")
                .body("{\"client.id\":\"1234567890\",\"loanAmount\":99999}");

    // when:
        ResponseOptions response = given().spec(request)
                .put("/fraudcheck");

    // then:
        assertThat(response.statusCode()).isEqualTo(200);
        assertThat(response.header("Content-Type")).matches("application/vnd.fraud.v1.json.*");
    // and:
        DocumentContext parsedJson = JsonPath.parse(response.getBody().asString());
        assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("['fraudCheckStatus']").matches("[A-Z]{5}");
        assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("['rejection.reason']").isEqualTo("Amount too high");
}</programlisting>
<simpara>If you used the Groovy DSL, you can see, all the <literal>producer()</literal> parts of the Contract that were present in the
<literal>value(consumer(&#8230;&#8203;), producer(&#8230;&#8203;))</literal> blocks got injected into the test.
In case of using YAML, the same applied for the <literal>matchers</literal> sections of the <literal>response</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Note that, on the producer side, you are also doing TDD. The expectations are expressed
in the form of a test. This test sends a request to our own application with the URL,
headers, and body defined in the contract. It also is expecting precisely defined values
in the response. In other words, you have the <literal>red</literal> part of <literal>red</literal>, <literal>green</literal>, and
<literal>refactor</literal>. It is time to convert the <literal>red</literal> into the <literal>green</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Write the missing implementation.</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>Because you know the expected input and expected output, you can write the missing
implementation:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RequestMapping(value = "/fraudcheck", method = PUT)
public FraudCheckResult fraudCheck(@RequestBody FraudCheck fraudCheck) {
if (amountGreaterThanThreshold(fraudCheck)) {
	return new FraudCheckResult(FraudCheckStatus.FRAUD, AMOUNT_TOO_HIGH);
}
return new FraudCheckResult(FraudCheckStatus.OK, NO_REASON);
}</programlisting>
<simpara>When you execute <literal>./mvnw clean install</literal> again, the tests pass. Since the <literal>Spring Cloud
Contract Verifier</literal> plugin adds the tests to the <literal>generated-test-sources</literal>, you can
actually run those tests from your IDE.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Deploy your app.</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>Once you finish your work, you can deploy your change. First, merge the branch:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ git checkout master
$ git merge --no-ff contract-change-pr
$ git push origin master</programlisting>
<simpara>Your CI might run something like <literal>./mvnw clean deploy</literal>, which would publish both the
application and the stub artifacts.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_what_is_this_value_consumer_producer">
<title>What is this value(consumer(), producer()) ?</title>
<simpara>One of the biggest challenges related to stubs is their reusability. Only if they can be vastly used, will they serve their purpose.
What typically makes that difficult are the hard-coded values of request / response elements. For example dates or ids.
Imagine the following JSON request</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
    "time" : "2016-10-10 20:10:15",
    "id" : "9febab1c-6f36-4a0b-88d6-3b6a6d81cd4a",
    "body" : "foo"
}</programlisting>
<simpara>and JSON response</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
    "time" : "2016-10-10 21:10:15",
    "id" : "c4231e1f-3ca9-48d3-b7e7-567d55f0d051",
    "body" : "bar"
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Imagine the pain required to set proper value of the <literal>time</literal> field (let&#8217;s assume that this content is generated by the
database) by changing the clock in the system or providing stub implementations of data providers. The same is related
to the field called <literal>id</literal>. Will you create a stubbed implementation of UUID generator? Makes little sense&#8230;&#8203;</simpara>
<simpara>So as a consumer you would like to send a request that matches any form of a time or any UUID. That way your system
will work as usual - will generate data and you won&#8217;t have to stub anything out. Let&#8217;s assume that in case of the aforementioned
JSON the most important part is the <literal>body</literal> field. You can focus on that and provide matching for other fields. In other words
you would like the stub to work like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
    "time" : "SOMETHING THAT MATCHES TIME",
    "id" : "SOMETHING THAT MATCHES UUID",
    "body" : "foo"
}</programlisting>
<simpara>As far as the response goes as a consumer you need a concrete value that you can operate on. So such a JSON is valid</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
    "time" : "2016-10-10 21:10:15",
    "id" : "c4231e1f-3ca9-48d3-b7e7-567d55f0d051",
    "body" : "bar"
}</programlisting>
<simpara>As you could see in the previous sections we generate tests from contracts. So from the producer&#8217;s side the situation looks
much different. We&#8217;re parsing the provided contract and in the test we want to send a real request to your endpoints.
So for the case of a producer for the request we can&#8217;t have any sort of matching. We need concrete values that the
producer&#8217;s backend can work on. Such a JSON would be a valid one:</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
    "time" : "2016-10-10 20:10:15",
    "id" : "9febab1c-6f36-4a0b-88d6-3b6a6d81cd4a",
    "body" : "foo"
}</programlisting>
<simpara>On the other hand from the point of view of the validity of the contract the response doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to
contain concrete values of <literal>time</literal> or <literal>id</literal>. Let&#8217;s say that you generate those on the producer side - again, you&#8217;d
have to do a lot of stubbing to ensure that you always return the same values. That&#8217;s why from the producer&#8217;s side
what you might want is the following response:</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
    "time" : "SOMETHING THAT MATCHES TIME",
    "id" : "SOMETHING THAT MATCHES UUID",
    "body" : "bar"
}</programlisting>
<simpara>How can you then provide one time a matcher for the consumer and a concrete value for the producer and vice versa?
In Spring Cloud Contract we&#8217;re allowing you to provide a <emphasis role="strong">dynamic value</emphasis>. That means that it can differ for both
sides of the communication. You can pass the values:</simpara>
<simpara>Either via the <literal>value</literal> method</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">value(consumer(...), producer(...))
value(stub(...), test(...))
value(client(...), server(...))</programlisting>
<simpara>or using the <literal>$()</literal> method</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">$(consumer(...), producer(...))
$(stub(...), test(...))
$(client(...), server(...))</programlisting>
<simpara>You can read more about this in the <link xl:href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/single/spring-cloud-contract.html#_contract_dsl">Contract DSL section</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>Calling <literal>value()</literal> or <literal>$()</literal> tells Spring Cloud Contract that you will be passing a dynamic value.
Inside the <literal>consumer()</literal> method you pass the value that should be used on the consumer side (in the generated stub).
Inside the <literal>producer()</literal> method you pass the value that should be used on the producer side (in the generated test).</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>If on one side you have passed the regular expression and you haven&#8217;t passed the other, then the
other side will get auto-generated.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>Most often you will use that method together with the <literal>regex</literal> helper method. E.g. <literal>consumer(regex('[0-9]{10}'))</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To sum it up the contract for the aforementioned scenario would look more or less like this (the regular expression
for time and UUID are simplified and most likely invalid but we want to keep things very simple in this example):</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
				request {
					method 'GET'
					url '/someUrl'
					body([
					    time : value(consumer(regex('[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2} [0-2][0-9]-[0-5][0-9]-[0-5][0-9]')),
					    id: value(consumer(regex('[0-9a-zA-z]{8}-[0-9a-zA-z]{4}-[0-9a-zA-z]{4}-[0-9a-zA-z]{12}'))
					    body: "foo"
					])
				}
			response {
				status OK()
				body([
					    time : value(producer(regex('[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2} [0-2][0-9]-[0-5][0-9]-[0-5][0-9]')),
					    id: value([producer(regex('[0-9a-zA-z]{8}-[0-9a-zA-z]{4}-[0-9a-zA-z]{4}-[0-9a-zA-z]{12}'))
					    body: "bar"
					])
			}
}</programlisting>

properly structure the request / response bodies.</simpara>

<title>API Versioning</title>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s try to answer a question what versioning really means. If you&#8217;re referring to the API version then there are
different approaches.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>use Hypermedia, links and do not version your API by any means</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>pass versions through headers / urls</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>I will not try to answer a question which approach is better. Whatever suit your needs and allows you to generate
business value should be picked.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s assume that you do version your API. In that case you should provide as many contracts as many versions you support.
You can create a subfolder for every version or append it to th contract name - whatever suits you more.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_jar_versioning">
<title>JAR versioning</title>
<simpara>If by versioning you mean the version of the JAR that contains the stubs then there are essentially two main approaches.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s assume that you&#8217;re doing Continuous Delivery / Deployment which means that you&#8217;re generating a new version of
the jar each time you go through the pipeline and that jar can go to production at any time. For example your jar version
looks like this (it got built on the 20.10.2016 at 20:15:21) :</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">1.0.0.20161020-201521-RELEASE</programlisting>
<simpara>In that case your generated stub jar will look like this.</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">1.0.0.20161020-201521-RELEASE-stubs.jar</programlisting>
<simpara>In this case you should inside your <literal>application.yml</literal> or <literal>@AutoConfigureStubRunner</literal> when referencing stubs provide the
 latest version of the stubs. You can do that by passing the <literal>+</literal> sign. Example</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:http-server-dsl:+:stubs:8080"})</programlisting>
<simpara>If the versioning however is fixed (e.g. <literal>1.0.4.RELEASE</literal> or <literal>2.1.1</literal>) then you have to set the concrete value of the jar
version. Example for 2.1.1.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:http-server-dsl:2.1.1:stubs:8080"})</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_dev_or_prod_stubs">
<title>Dev or prod stubs</title>
<simpara>You can manipulate the classifier to run the tests against current development version of the stubs of other services
 or the ones that were deployed to production. If you alter your build to deploy the stubs with the <literal>prod-stubs</literal> classifier
 once you reach production deployment then you can run tests in one case with dev stubs and one with prod stubs.</simpara>
<simpara>Example of tests using development version of stubs</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:http-server-dsl:+:stubs:8080"})</programlisting>
<simpara>Example of tests using production version of stubs</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:http-server-dsl:+:prod-stubs:8080"})</programlisting>
<simpara>You can pass those values also via properties from your deployment pipeline.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="_common_repo_with_contracts">
<title>Common repo with contracts</title>
<simpara>Another way of storing contracts other than having them with the producer is keeping them in a common place.
It can be related to security issues where the consumers can&#8217;t clone the producer&#8217;s code. Also if you keep
contracts in a single place then you, as a producer, will know how many consumers you have and which
consumer will you break with your local changes.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_repo_structure">
<title>Repo structure</title>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s assume that we have a producer with coordinates <literal>com.example:server</literal> and 3 consumers: <literal>client1</literal>,
<literal>client2</literal>, <literal>client3</literal>. Then in the repository with common contracts you would have the following setup
(which you can checkout <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/tree/1.0.x/samples/standalone/contracts">here</link>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">├── com

        └── contracts.xml</programlisting>
<simpara>As you can see the under the slash-delimited groupid <literal>/</literal> artifact id folder (<literal>com/example/server</literal>) you have
expectations of the 3 consumers (<literal>client1</literal>, <literal>client2</literal> and <literal>client3</literal>). Expectations are the standard Groovy DSL
contract files as described throughout this documentation. This repository has to produce a JAR file that maps
one to one to the contents of the repo.</simpara>

<simpara>As you can see there are no dependencies other than the Spring Cloud Contract Maven Plugin.
Those poms are necessary for the consumer side to run <literal>mvn clean install -DskipTests</literal> to locally install
 stubs of the producer project.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>pom.xml</literal> in the root folder can look like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

	&lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;

	&lt;groupId&gt;com.example.standalone&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;contracts&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;version&gt;0.0.1-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;

	&lt;name&gt;Contracts&lt;/name&gt;
	&lt;description&gt;Contains all the Spring Cloud Contracts, well, contracts. JAR used by the producers to generate tests and stubs&lt;/description&gt;

	&lt;properties&gt;
		&lt;project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;UTF-8&lt;/project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;
	&lt;/properties&gt;

	&lt;build&gt;

						&lt;/configuration&gt;
					&lt;/execution&gt;
				&lt;/executions&gt;
			&lt;/plugin&gt;
		&lt;/plugins&gt;
	&lt;/build&gt;

&lt;/project&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>It&#8217;s using the assembly plugin in order to build the JAR with all the contracts. Example of such setup is here:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;assembly xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/assembly/1.1.3"

	&lt;/fileSets&gt;
&lt;/assembly&gt;</programlisting>

<section xml:id="_workflow">
<title>Workflow</title>
<simpara>The workflow would look similar to the one presented in the <literal>Step by step guide to CDC</literal>. The only difference
 is that the producer doesn&#8217;t own the contracts anymore. So the consumer and the producer have to work on
 common contracts in a common repository.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_consumer">
<title>Consumer</title>
<simpara>When the <emphasis role="strong">consumer</emphasis> wants to work on the contracts offline, instead of cloning the producer code, the
consumer team clones the common repository, goes to the required producer&#8217;s folder (e.g. <literal>com/example/server</literal>)
and runs <literal>mvn clean install -DskipTests</literal> to install locally the stubs converted from the contracts.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>You need to have <link xl:href="http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi">Maven installed locally</link></simpara>
</tip>
</section>
<section xml:id="_producer">
<title>Producer</title>
<simpara>As a <emphasis role="strong">producer</emphasis> it&#8217;s enough to alter the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier to provide the URL and the dependency
of the JAR containing the contracts:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;plugin&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;configuration&gt;
		&lt;contractsRepositoryUrl&gt;http://link/to/your/nexus/or/artifactory/or/sth&lt;/contractsRepositoryUrl&gt;
		&lt;contractDependency&gt;
			&lt;groupId&gt;com.example.standalone&lt;/groupId&gt;
			&lt;artifactId&gt;contracts&lt;/artifactId&gt;
		&lt;/contractDependency&gt;
	&lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>With this setup the JAR with groupid <literal>com.example.standalone</literal> and artifactid <literal>contracts</literal> will be downloaded
from <literal><link xl:href="http://link/to/your/nexus/or/artifactory/or/sth">http://link/to/your/nexus/or/artifactory/or/sth</link></literal>. It will be then unpacked in a local temporary folder
and contracts present under the <literal>com/example/server</literal> will be picked as the ones used to generate the
tests and the stubs. Due to this convention the producer team will know which consumer teams will be broken
when some incompatible changes are done.</simpara>
<simpara>The rest of the flow looks the same.</simpara>

<simpara>The directory containing stub definitions is treated as a class name, and each stub
definition is treated as a single test. Spring Cloud Contract Verifier assumes that it
contains at  least one level of directories that are to be used as the test class name.
If more than  one level of nested directories is present, all except the last one is used
as the package name. For example, with following structure:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">src/test/resources/contracts/myservice/shouldCreateUser.groovy
src/test/resources/contracts/myservice/shouldReturnUser.groovy</programlisting>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier creates a test class named <literal>defaultBasePackage.MyService</literal>

<section xml:id="gradle-different-base-classes">
<title>Different Base Classes for Contracts</title>
<simpara>If your base classes differ between contracts, you can tell the Spring Cloud Contract
plugin which class should get extended by the autogenerated tests. You have two options:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Follow a convention by providing the <literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Provide explicit mapping via <literal>baseClassMappings</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">By Convention</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>The convention is such that if you have a contract under (for example)
<literal>src/test/resources/contract/foo/bar/baz/</literal> and set the value of the
<literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal> property to <literal>com.example.base</literal>, then Spring Cloud Contract
Verifier assumes that there is a <literal>BarBazBase</literal> class under the <literal>com.example.base</literal> package.
In other words, the system takes the last two parts of the package, if they exist, and
forms a class with a <literal>Base</literal> suffix. This rule takes precedence over <emphasis role="strong">baseClassForTests</emphasis>.
Here is an example of how it works in the <literal>contracts</literal> closure:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">packageWithBaseClasses = 'com.example.base'</programlisting>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">By Mapping</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>You can manually map a regular expression of the contract&#8217;s package to fully qualified
name of the base class for the matched contract. You have to provide a list called
<literal>baseClassMappings</literal> that consists <literal>baseClassMapping</literal> objects that takes a
<literal>contractPackageRegex</literal> to <literal>baseClassFQN</literal> mapping. Consider the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">baseClassForTests = "com.example.FooBase"
baseClassMappings {
	baseClassMapping('.*/com/.*', 'com.example.ComBase')
	baseClassMapping('.*/bar/.*':'com.example.BarBase')
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s assume that you have contracts under
 - <literal>src/test/resources/contract/com/</literal>
 - <literal>src/test/resources/contract/foo/</literal></simpara>
<simpara>By providing the <literal>baseClassForTests</literal>, we have a fallback in case mapping did not succeed.
(You could also provide the <literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal> as a fallback.) That way, the tests
generated from <literal>src/test/resources/contract/com/</literal> contracts extend the
<literal>com.example.ComBase</literal>, whereas the rest of the tests extend <literal>com.example.FooBase</literal>.</simpara>

<section xml:id="maven-different-base">
<title>Different base classes for contracts</title>
<simpara>If your base classes differ between contracts, you can tell the Spring Cloud Contract
plugin which class should get extended by the autogenerated tests. You have two options:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Follow a convention by providing the <literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>provide explicit mapping via <literal>baseClassMappings</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">By Convention</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>The convention is such that if you have a contract under (for example)
<literal>src/test/resources/contract/foo/bar/baz/</literal> and set the value of the
<literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal> property to <literal>com.example.base</literal>, then Spring Cloud Contract
Verifier assumes that there is a <literal>BarBazBase</literal> class under the <literal>com.example.base</literal> package.
In other words, the system takes the last two parts of the package, if they exist, and
forms a class with a <literal>Base</literal> suffix. This rule takes precedence over <emphasis role="strong">baseClassForTests</emphasis>.
Here is an example of how it works in the <literal>contracts</literal> closure:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;plugin&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;configuration&gt;
		&lt;packageWithBaseClasses&gt;hello&lt;/packageWithBaseClasses&gt;
	&lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">By Mapping</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>You can manually map a regular expression of the contract&#8217;s package to fully qualified
name of the base class for the matched contract. You have to provide a list called
<literal>baseClassMappings</literal> that consists <literal>baseClassMapping</literal> objects that takes a
<literal>contractPackageRegex</literal> to <literal>baseClassFQN</literal> mapping. Consider the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;plugin&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;configuration&gt;
		&lt;baseClassForTests&gt;com.example.FooBase&lt;/baseClassForTests&gt;
		&lt;baseClassMappings&gt;
			&lt;baseClassMapping&gt;
				&lt;contractPackageRegex&gt;.*com.*&lt;/contractPackageRegex&gt;
				&lt;baseClassFQN&gt;com.example.TestBase&lt;/baseClassFQN&gt;
			&lt;/baseClassMapping&gt;
		&lt;/baseClassMappings&gt;
	&lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Assume that you have contracts under these two locations:
* <literal>src/test/resources/contract/com/</literal>
* <literal>src/test/resources/contract/foo/</literal></simpara>
<simpara>By providing the <literal>baseClassForTests</literal>, we have a fallback in case mapping did not succeed.
(You can also provide the <literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal> as a fallback.) That way, the tests
generated from <literal>src/test/resources/contract/com/</literal> contracts extend the
<literal>com.example.ComBase</literal>, whereas the rest of the tests extend <literal>com.example.FooBase</literal>.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_stubs_and_transitive_dependencies">
<title>Stubs and Transitive Dependencies</title>
<simpara>The Maven and Gradle plugin that add the tasks that create the stubs jar for you. One
problem that arises is that, when reusing the stubs, you can mistakenly import all of
that stub&#8217;s dependencies. When building a Maven artifact, even though you have a couple
of different jars, all of them share one pom:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-20160903.075506-1-stubs.jar
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-20160903.075506-1-stubs.jar.sha1

├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.pom
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT-stubs.jar
├── ...
└── ...</programlisting>
<simpara>There are three possibilities of working with those dependencies so as not to have any
issues with transitive dependencies:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Mark all application dependencies as optional</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Create a separate artifactid for the stubs</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Exclude dependencies on the consumer side</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Mark all application dependencies as optional</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>If, in the <literal>github-webhook</literal> application, you mark all of your dependencies as optional,
when you include the <literal>github-webhook</literal> stubs in another application (or when that
dependency gets downloaded by Stub Runner) then, since all of the dependencies are
optional, they will not get downloaded.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Create a separate <literal>artifactid</literal> for the stubs</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>If you create a separate <literal>artifactid</literal>, then you can set it up in whatever way you wish.
For example, you might decide to have no dependencies at all.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Exclude dependencies on the consumer side</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>As a consumer, if you add the stub dependency to your classpath, you can explicitly
exclude the unwanted dependencies.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_ci_server_setup">
<title>CI Server setup</title>
<simpara>When fetching stubs / contracts in a CI, shared environment, what might happen is that
both the producer and the consumer reuse the same local Maven repository. Due to this,
the framework, responsible for downloading a stub JAR from remote location,
can&#8217;t decide which JAR should be picked, local or remote one. That caused
the <literal>"The artifact was found in the local repository but you have explicitly
stated that it should be downloaded from a remote one"</literal> exception
and failed the build.</simpara>
<simpara>For such cases we&#8217;re introducing the property and plugin setup mechanism:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>via <literal>stubrunner.snapshot-check-skip</literal> system property</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>via <literal>STUBRUNNER_SNAPSHOT_CHECK_SKIP</literal> environment variable</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>if either of these values is set to <literal>true</literal>, then the stub downloader will not
verify the origin of the downloaded JAR.</simpara>
<simpara>For the plugins you need to set the <literal>contractsSnapshotSkipCheck</literal> property
to <literal>true</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_scenarios">
<title>Scenarios</title>
<simpara>You can handle scenarios with Spring Cloud Contract Verifier. All you need to do is to
stick to the proper naming convention while creating your contracts. The convention
requires including an order number followed by an underscore. This will work regardles
 of whether you&#8217;re working with YAML or Groovy. Example:</simpara>
<screen>my_contracts_dir\
  scenario1\
    1_login.groovy
    2_showCart.groovy
    3_logout.groovy</screen>
<simpara>Such a tree causes Spring Cloud Contract Verifier to generate WireMock&#8217;s scenario with a
name of <literal>scenario1</literal> and the three following steps:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>login marked as <literal>Started</literal> pointing to&#8230;&#8203;</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>showCart marked as <literal>Step1</literal> pointing to&#8230;&#8203;</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>logout marked as <literal>Step2</literal> which will close the scenario.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_short_intro_to_maven_jars_and_binary_storage">
<title>Short intro to Maven, JARs and Binary storage</title>
<simpara>Since the Docker image can be used by non JVM projects, it&#8217;s good to
explain the basic terms behind Spring Cloud Contract packaging defaults.</simpara>
<simpara>Part of the following definitions were taken from the <link xl:href="https://maven.apache.org/glossary.html">Maven Glossary</link></simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>Project</literal>: Maven thinks in terms of projects. Everything that you
will build are projects. Those projects follow a well defined
“Project Object Model”. Projects can depend on other projects,
in which case the latter are called “dependencies”. A project may
consistent of several subprojects, however these subprojects are still
treated equally as projects.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>Artifact</literal>: An artifact is something that is either produced or used
by a project. Examples of artifacts produced by Maven for a project
include: JARs, source and binary distributions. Each artifact
is uniquely identified by a group id and an artifact ID which is
unique within a group.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>JAR</literal>: JAR stands for Java ARchive. It&#8217;s a format based on
the ZIP file format. Spring Cloud Contract packages the contracts and generated
stubs in a JAR file.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>GroupId</literal>: A group ID is a universally unique identifier for a project.
While this is often just the project name (eg. commons-collections),
it is helpful to use a fully-qualified package name to distinguish it
from other projects with a similar name (eg. org.apache.maven).
Typically, when published to the Artifact Manager, the <literal>GroupId</literal> will get
slash separated and form part of the URL. E.g. for group id <literal>com.example</literal>
and artifact id <literal>application</literal> would be <literal>/com/example/application/</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>Classifier</literal>: The Maven dependency notation looks as follows:
<literal>groupId:artifactId:version:classifier</literal>. The classifier is additional suffix
passed to the dependency. E.g. <literal>stubs</literal>, <literal>sources</literal>. The same dependency
e.g. <literal>com.example:application</literal> can produce multiple artifacts that
differ from each other with the classifier.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>Artifact manager</literal>: When you generate binaries / sources / packages, you would
like them to be available for others to download / reference or reuse. In case
of the JVM world those artifacts would be JARs, for Ruby these are gems
and for Docker those would be Docker images. You can store those artifacts
in a manager. Examples of such managers can be <link xl:href="https://jfrog.com/artifactory/">Artifactory</link>
or <link xl:href="http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/">Nexus</link>.</simpara>

<title>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier Messaging</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier lets you verify applications that use messaging as a
means of communication. All of the integrations shown in this document work with Spring,
but you can also create one of your own and use that.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_integrations_2">
<title>Integrations</title>
<simpara>You can use one of the following four integration configurations:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Spring AMQP</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Since we use Spring Boot, if you have added one of these libraries to the classpath, all
the messaging configuration is automatically set up.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>Remember to put <literal>@AutoConfigureMessageVerifier</literal> on the base class of your
generated tests. Otherwise, messaging part of Spring Cloud Contract Verifier does not
work.</simpara>
</important>

<title>Manual Integration Testing</title>
<simpara>The main interface used by the tests is
<literal>org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.messaging.MessageVerifier</literal>.
It defines how to send and receive messages. You can create your own implementation to
achieve the same goal.</simpara>
<simpara>In a test, you can inject a <literal>ContractVerifierMessageExchange</literal> to send and receive
messages that follow the contract. Then add <literal>@AutoConfigureMessageVerifier</literal> to your test.
Here&#8217;s an example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringTestRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureMessageVerifier
public static class MessagingContractTests {

  @Autowired
  private MessageVerifier verifier;
  ...
}</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>If your tests require stubs as well, then <literal>@AutoConfigureStubRunner</literal> includes the
messaging configuration, so you only need the one annotation.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_publisher_side_test_generation">
<title>Publisher-Side Test Generation</title>
<simpara>Having the <literal>input</literal> or <literal>outputMessage</literal> sections in your DSL results in creation of tests
on the publisher&#8217;s side. By default, JUnit tests are created. However, there is also a
possibility to create Spock tests.</simpara>
<simpara>There are 3 main scenarios that we should take into consideration:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Scenario 1: There is no input message that produces an output message. The output
message  is triggered by a component inside the application (for example, scheduler).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Scenario 2: The input message triggers an output message.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Scenario 3: The input message is consumed and there is no output message.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<important>
<simpara>The destination passed to <literal>messageFrom</literal> or <literal>sentTo</literal> can have different
meanings for different messaging implementations. For <emphasis role="strong">Stream</emphasis> and <emphasis role="strong">Integration</emphasis> it is
first resolved as a <literal>destination</literal> of a channel. Then, if there is no such <literal>destination</literal>
it is resolved as a channel name. For <emphasis role="strong">Camel</emphasis>, that&#8217;s a certain component (for example,

<section xml:id="_stub_runner_boot_with_service_discovery">
<title>Stub Runner Boot with Service Discovery</title>
<simpara>One of the possibilities of using Stub Runner Boot is to use it as a feed of stubs for "smoke-tests". What does it mean?
 Let&#8217;s assume that you don&#8217;t want to deploy 50 microservice to a test environment in order
 to check if your application is working fine. You&#8217;ve already executed a suite of tests during the build process
 but you would also like to ensure that the packaging of your application is fine. What you can do
 is to deploy your application to an environment, start it and run a couple of tests on it to see if
 it&#8217;s working fine. We can call those tests smoke-tests since their idea is to check only a handful
 of testing scenarios.</simpara>
<simpara>The problem with this approach is such that if you&#8217;re doing microservices most likely you&#8217;re
 using a service discovery tool. Stub Runner Boot allows you to solve this issue by starting the
 required stubs and register them in a service discovery tool. Let&#8217;s take a look at an example of
 such a setup with Eureka. Let&#8217;s assume that Eureka was already running.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@EnableStubRunnerServer
@EnableEurekaClient
@AutoConfigureStubRunner
public class StubRunnerBootEurekaExample {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(StubRunnerBootEurekaExample.class, args);
	}

}</programlisting>
<simpara>As you can see we want to start a Stub Runner Boot server <literal>@EnableStubRunnerServer</literal>, enable Eureka client <literal>@EnableEurekaClient</literal>
and we want to have the stub runner feature turned on <literal>@AutoConfigureStubRunner</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Now let&#8217;s assume that we want to start this application so that the stubs get automatically registered.
 We can do it by running the app <literal>java -jar ${SYSTEM_PROPS} stub-runner-boot-eureka-example.jar</literal> where
 <literal>${SYSTEM_PROPS}</literal> would contain the following list of properties</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">-Dstubrunner.repositoryRoot=http://repo.spring.io/snapshots (1)
-Dstubrunner.cloud.stubbed.discovery.enabled=false (2)
-Dstubrunner.ids=org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.stubs:loanIssuance,org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.stubs:fraudDetectionServer,org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.stubs:bootService (3)
-Dstubrunner.idsToServiceIds.fraudDetectionServer=someNameThatShouldMapFraudDetectionServer (4)

(1) - we tell Stub Runner where all the stubs reside
(2) - we don't want the default behaviour where the discovery service is stubbed. That's why the stub registration will be picked
(3) - we provide a list of stubs to download
(4) - we provide a list of artifactId to serviceId mapping</programlisting>
<simpara>That way your deployed application can send requests to started WireMock servers via the service
discovery. Most likely points 1-3 could be set by default in <literal>application.yml</literal> cause they are not
likely to change. That way you can provide only the list of stubs to download whenever you start
the Stub Runner Boot.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="_stubs_per_consumer">
<title>Stubs Per Consumer</title>
<simpara>There are cases in which 2 consumers of the same endpoint want to have 2 different responses.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>This approach also allows you to immediately know which consumer is using which part of your API.
You can remove part of a response that your API produces and you can see which of your autogenerated tests
fails. If none fails then you can safely delete that part of the response cause nobody is using it.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s look at the following example for contract defined for the producer called <literal>producer</literal>.
There are 2 consumers: <literal>foo-consumer</literal> and <literal>bar-consumer</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Consumer <literal>foo-service</literal></emphasis></simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">request {
   url '/foo'
   method GET()
}
response {
    status OK()
    body(
       foo: "foo"
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Consumer <literal>bar-service</literal></emphasis></simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">request {
   url '/foo'
   method GET()
}
response {
    status OK()
    body(
       bar: "bar"
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>You can&#8217;t produce for the same request 2 different responses. That&#8217;s why you can properly package the
contracts and then profit from the <literal>stubsPerConsumer</literal> feature.</simpara>
<simpara>On the producer side the consumers can have a folder that contains contracts related only to them.
By setting the <literal>stubrunner.stubs-per-consumer</literal> flag to <literal>true</literal> we no longer register all stubs but only those that
correspond to the consumer application&#8217;s name. In other words we&#8217;ll scan the path of every stub and
if it contains the subfolder with name of the consumer in the path only then will it get registered.</simpara>
<simpara>On the <literal>foo</literal> producer side the contracts would look like this</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">.
└── contracts
    ├── bar-consumer
    │   ├── bookReturnedForBar.groovy
    │   └── shouldCallBar.groovy
    └── foo-consumer
        ├── bookReturnedForFoo.groovy
        └── shouldCallFoo.groovy</programlisting>
<simpara>Being the <literal>bar-consumer</literal> consumer you can either set the <literal>spring.application.name</literal> or the <literal>stubrunner.consumer-name</literal> to <literal>bar-consumer</literal>
Or set the test as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">@ContextConfiguration(classes = Config, loader = SpringBootContextLoader)
@SpringBootTest(properties = ["spring.application.name=bar-consumer"])
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = "org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.stubs:producerWithMultipleConsumers",

		stubsMode = StubRunnerProperties.StubsMode.REMOTE,
		stubsPerConsumer = true)
@DirtiesContext
class StubRunnerStubsPerConsumerSpec extends Specification {
...
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Then only the stubs registered under a path that contains the <literal>bar-consumer</literal> in its name (i.e. those from the
<literal>src/test/resources/contracts/bar-consumer/some/contracts/&#8230;&#8203;</literal> folder) will be allowed to be referenced.</simpara>
<simpara>Or set the consumer name explicitly</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">@ContextConfiguration(classes = Config, loader = SpringBootContextLoader)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = "org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.stubs:producerWithMultipleConsumers",

		stubsPerConsumer = true)
@DirtiesContext
class StubRunnerStubsPerConsumerWithConsumerNameSpec extends Specification {

<simpara>Then only the stubs registered under a path that contains the <literal>foo-consumer</literal> in its name (i.e. those from the

<title>Stub Runner for Messaging</title>
<simpara>Stub Runner can run the published stubs in memory. It can integrate with the following
frameworks:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Spring Integration</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Spring AMQP</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>It also provides entry points to integrate with any other solution on the market.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>If you have multiple frameworks on the classpath Stub Runner will need to
define which one should be used. Let&#8217;s assume that you have both AMQP, Spring Cloud Stream and Spring Integration
on the classpath. Then you need to set <literal>stubrunner.stream.enabled=false</literal> and <literal>stubrunner.integration.enabled=false</literal>.
That way the only remaining framework is Spring AMQP.</simpara>

<title>Stub Runner Spring AMQP</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier Stub Runner&#8217;s messaging module provides an easy way to
integrate with Spring AMQP&#8217;s Rabbit Template. For the provided artifacts, it
automatically downloads the stubs and registers the required routes.</simpara>
<simpara>The integration tries to work standalone (that is, without interaction with a running
RabbitMQ message broker). It expects a <literal>RabbitTemplate</literal> on the application context and
uses it as a spring boot test named <literal>@SpyBean</literal>. As a result, it can use the mockito spy
functionality to verify and inspect messages sent by the application.</simpara>
<simpara>On the message consumer side, the stub runner considers all <literal>@RabbitListener</literal> annotated
endpoints and all <literal>SimpleMessageListenerContainer</literal> objects on the application context.</simpara>
<simpara>As messages are usually sent to exchanges in AMQP, the message contract contains the
exchange name as the destination. Message listeners on the other side are bound to
queues. Bindings connect an exchange to a queue. If message contracts are triggered, the
Spring AMQP stub runner integration looks for bindings on the application context that
match this exchange. Then it collects the queues from the Spring exchanges and tries to
find message listeners bound to these queues. The message is triggered for all matching
message listeners.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_adding_the_runner_to_the_project_3">
<title>Adding the Runner to the Project</title>
<simpara>You can have both Spring AMQP and Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner on the classpath and

<simpara>If you already have Stream and Integration on the classpath, you need

<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">├── META-INF

<simpara>Consider the following contract:</simpara>

<section xml:id="_triggering_the_message">

follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">stubTrigger.trigger("contract-test.person.created.event")</programlisting>
<simpara>The message has a destination of <literal>contract-test.exchange</literal>, so the Spring AMQP stub runner

<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean

<title>Contract DSL</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract supports out of the box 2 types of DSL. One written in
<literal>Groovy</literal> and one written in <literal>YAML</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>If you decide to write the contract in Groovy, do not be alarmed if you have not used Groovy
before. Knowledge of the language is not really needed, as the Contract DSL uses only a
tiny subset of it (only literals, method calls and closures). Also, the DSL is statically
typed, to make it programmer-readable without any knowledge of the DSL itself.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>Remember that, inside the Groovy contract file, you have to provide the fully
qualified name to the <literal>Contract</literal> class and <literal>make</literal> static imports, such as
<literal>org.springframework.cloud.spec.Contract.make { &#8230;&#8203; }</literal>. You can also provide an import to
the <literal>Contract</literal> class: <literal>import org.springframework.cloud.spec.Contract</literal> and then call
<literal>Contract.make { &#8230;&#8203; }</literal>.</simpara>
</important>

<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier does not properly support XML. Please use JSON or
help us implement this feature.</simpara>
</warning>
<warning>
<simpara>The support for verifying the size of JSON arrays is experimental. If you want

<warning>
<simpara>Because JSON structure can have any form, it can be impossible to parse it
properly when using the Groovy DSL and the <literal>value(consumer(&#8230;&#8203;), producer(&#8230;&#8203;))</literal> notation in <literal>GString</literal>. That

<tip>
<simpara>Via the Groovy DSL you can reference the <literal>org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.internal.HttpStatus</literal>
methods to provide a meaningful status instead of a digit. E.g. you can call

</tip>
</section>
<section xml:id="_dynamic_properties">
<title>Dynamic properties</title>
<simpara>The contract can contain some dynamic properties: timestamps, IDs, and so on. You do not
want to force the consumers to stub their clocks to always return the same value of time
so that it gets matched by the stub.</simpara>
<simpara>For Groovy DSL you can provide the dynamic parts in your contracts
in two ways: pass them directly in the body or set them in separate sections called
<literal>testMatchers</literal> and <literal>stubMatchers</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>For YAML you can only use the <literal>matchers</literal> section.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_dynamic_properties_inside_the_body">
<title>Dynamic properties inside the body</title>
<important>
<simpara>This section is valid only for Groovy DSL. Check out the
<xref linkend="contract-matchers"/> section for YAML examples of a similar feature.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>You can set the properties inside the body either with the <literal>value</literal> method or, if you use
the Groovy map notation, with <literal>$()</literal>. The following example shows how to set dynamic
properties with the value method:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">value(consumer(...), producer(...))
value(c(...), p(...))
value(stub(...), test(...))
value(client(...), server(...))</programlisting>
<simpara>The following example shows how to set dynamic properties with <literal>$()</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">$(consumer(...), producer(...))
$(c(...), p(...))
$(stub(...), test(...))
$(client(...), server(...))</programlisting>
<simpara>Both approaches work equally well. <literal>stub</literal> and <literal>client</literal> methods are aliases over the <literal>consumer</literal>
method. Subsequent sections take a closer look at what you can do with those values.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_regular_expressions">
<title>Regular expressions</title>
<important>
<simpara>This section is valid only for Groovy DSL. Check out the
<xref linkend="contract-matchers"/> section for YAML examples of a similar feature.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>You can use regular expressions to write your requests in Contract DSL. Doing so is
particularly useful when you want to indicate that a given response should be provided
for requests that follow a given pattern. Also, you can use regular expressions when you
need to use patterns and not exact values both for your test and your server side tests.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows how to use regular expressions to write a request:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
	request {
		method('GET')
		url $(consumer(~/\/[0-9]{2}/), producer('/12'))
	}
	response {
		status OK()
		body(
				id: $(anyNumber()),
				surname: $(
						consumer('Kowalsky'),
						producer(regex('[a-zA-Z]+'))
				),
				name: 'Jan',
				created: $(consumer('2014-02-02 12:23:43'), producer(execute('currentDate(it)'))),
				correlationId: value(consumer('5d1f9fef-e0dc-4f3d-a7e4-72d2220dd827'),
						producer(regex('[a-fA-F0-9]{8}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{12}'))
				)
		)
		headers {
			header 'Content-Type': 'text/plain'
		}
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>You can also provide only one side of the communication with a regular expression. If you
do so, then the contract engine automatically provides the generated string that matches
the provided regular expression. The following code shows an example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
	request {
		method 'PUT'
		url value(consumer(regex('/foo/[0-9]{5}')))
		body([
			requestElement: $(consumer(regex('[0-9]{5}')))
		])
		headers {
			header('header', $(consumer(regex('application\\/vnd\\.fraud\\.v1\\+json;.*'))))
		}
	}
	response {
		status OK()
		body([
			responseElement: $(producer(regex('[0-9]{7}')))
		])
		headers {
			contentType("application/vnd.fraud.v1+json")
		}
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In the preceding example, the opposite side of the communication has the respective data
generated for request and response.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract comes with a series of predefined regular expressions that you can
use in your contracts, as shown in the following example:</simpara>

<simpara>It is possible to provide optional parameters in your contract. However, you can provide
optional parameters only for the following:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis>TEST</emphasis> side of the Response</simpara>

	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>By wrapping a part of the body with the <literal>optional()</literal> method, you create a regular

<simpara>If you use Spock for, the following test would be generated from the previous example:</simpara>

 then:
  response.statusCode == 404
  response.header('Content-Type')  == 'application/json'
 and:
  DocumentContext parsedJson = JsonPath.parse(response.body.asString())
  assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("['code']").matches("(123123)?")

<simpara>You can define a method call that executes on the server side during the test. Such a
method can be added to the class defined as "baseClassForTests" in the configuration. The
following code shows an example of the contract portion of the test case:</simpara>

}</programlisting>
<important>
<simpara>You cannot use both a String and <literal>execute</literal> to perform concatenation. For
example, calling <literal>header('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + execute('authToken()'))</literal> leads to
improper results. Instead, call <literal>header('Authorization', execute('authToken()'))</literal> and
ensure that the <literal>authToken()</literal> method returns everything you need.</simpara>

<simpara>The type of the object read from the JSON can be one of the following, depending on the

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>String</literal>: If you point to a <literal>String</literal> value in the JSON.</simpara>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<simpara><literal>Boolean</literal>: If you point to a <literal>Boolean</literal> in the JSON.</simpara>

</itemizedlist>
<simpara>In the request part of the contract, you can specify that the <literal>body</literal> should be taken from
a method.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>You must provide both the consumer and the producer side. The <literal>execute</literal> part
is applied for the whole body - not for parts of it.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>The following example shows how to read an object from JSON:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">Contract contractDsl = Contract.make {

<simpara>The preceding example results in calling the <literal>hashCode()</literal> method in the request body.

<simpara>If you&#8217;re writing contracts using Groovy DSL, you can use the <literal>fromRequest()</literal> method, which lets
you reference a bunch of elements from the HTTP request. You can use the following
options:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>fromRequest().url()</literal>: Returns the request URL and query parameters.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>fromRequest().query(String key)</literal>: Returns the first query parameter with a given name.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>fromRequest().query(String key, int index)</literal>: Returns the nth query parameter with a
given name.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>fromRequest().path()</literal>: Returns the full path.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>fromRequest().path(int index)</literal>: Returns the nth path element.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>fromRequest().header(String key)</literal>: Returns the first header with a given name.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>fromRequest().header(String key, int index)</literal>: Returns the nth header with a given name.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>fromRequest().body()</literal>: Returns the full request body.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>fromRequest().body(String jsonPath)</literal>: Returns the element from the request that
matches the JSON Path.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>If you&#8217;re using the YAML contract definition you have to use the
<link xl:href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</link> <literal>{{{ }}}</literal> notation with custom, Spring Cloud Contract
 functions to achieve this.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>{{{ request.url }}}</literal>: Returns the request URL and query parameters.</simpara>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>{{{ request.path }}}</literal>: Returns the full path.</simpara>

<simpara>As you can see, elements from the request have been properly referenced in the response.</simpara>

<simpara>Sending a request such as the one presented in the <literal>request</literal> part of the contract results
in sending the following response body:</simpara>

<important>
<simpara>This feature works only with WireMock having a version greater than or equal
to 2.5.1. The Spring Cloud Contract Verifier uses WireMock&#8217;s
<literal>response-template</literal> response transformer. It uses Handlebars to convert the Mustache <literal>{{{ }}}</literal> templates into
proper values. Additionally, it registers two helper functions:</simpara>
</important>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>escapejsonbody</literal>: Escapes the request body in a format that can be embedded in a JSON.</simpara>

</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>
<section xml:id="_registering_your_own_wiremock_extension">
<title>Registering Your Own WireMock Extension</title>
<simpara>WireMock lets you register custom extensions. By default, Spring Cloud Contract registers
the transformer, which lets you reference a request from a response. If you want to
provide your own extensions, you can register an implementation of the
<literal>org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.dsl.wiremock.WireMockExtensions</literal> interface.
Since we use the spring.factories extension approach, you can create an entry in
<literal>META-INF/spring.factories</literal> file similar to the following:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.dsl.wiremock.WireMockExtensions=\
org.springframework.cloud.contract.stubrunner.provider.wiremock.TestWireMockExtensions</programlisting>
<simpara>The following is an example of a custom extension:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>TestWireMockExtensions.groovy</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">package org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.dsl.wiremock

import com.github.tomakehurst.wiremock.extension.Extension

/**

	@Override
	List&lt;Extension&gt; extensions() {

}

class CustomExtension implements Extension {

	@Override
	String getName() {
		return "foo-transformer"
	}
}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<important>
<simpara>Remember to override the <literal>applyGlobally()</literal> method and set it to <literal>false</literal> if you
want the transformation to be applied only for a mapping that explicitly requires it.</simpara>

<section xml:id="contract-matchers">
<title>Dynamic Properties in the Matchers Sections</title>
<simpara>If you work with <link xl:href="https://docs.pact.io/">Pact</link>, the following discussion may seem familiar.
Quite a few users are used to having a separation between the body and setting the
dynamic parts of a contract.</simpara>
<simpara>You can use two separate sections:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>stubMatchers</literal>, which lets you define the dynamic values that should end up in a stub.
You can set it in the <literal>request</literal> or <literal>inputMessage</literal> part of your contract.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>testMatchers</literal>, which is present in the <literal>response</literal> or <literal>outputMessage</literal> side of the
contract.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Currently, Spring Cloud Contract Verifier supports only JSON Path-based matchers with the
following matching possibilities:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<title>Groovy DSL</title>
<listitem>
<simpara>For <literal>stubMatchers</literal>:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>byEquality()</literal>: The value taken from the response via the provided JSON Path must be
equal to the value provided in the contract.</simpara>
</listitem>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>byType()</literal>: The value taken from the response via the provided JSON Path needs to be
of the same type as the type defined in the body of the response in the contract.
<literal>byType</literal> can take a closure, in which you can set <literal>minOccurrence</literal> and <literal>maxOccurrence</literal>.
That way, you can assert the size of the flattened collection. To check the size of an
unflattened collection, use a custom method with the <literal>byCommand(&#8230;&#8203;)</literal> testMatcher.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>byCommand(&#8230;&#8203;)</literal>: The value taken from the response via the provided JSON Path is
passed as an input to the custom method that you provide. For example,
<literal>byCommand('foo($it)')</literal> results in calling a <literal>foo</literal> method to which the value matching the
JSON Path gets passed. The type of the object read from the JSON can be one of the
following, depending on the JSON path:</simpara>

<simpara>In the preceding example, you can see the dynamic portions of the contract in the
<literal>matchers</literal> sections. For the request part, you can see that, for all fields but
<literal>valueWithoutAMatcher</literal>, the values of the regular expressions that the stub should
contain are explicitly set. For the <literal>valueWithoutAMatcher</literal>, the verification takes place
in the same way as without the use of matchers. In that case, the test performs an
equality check.</simpara>
<simpara>For the response side in the <literal>testMatchers</literal> section, we define the dynamic parts in a
similar manner. The only difference is that the <literal>byType</literal> matchers are also present. The
verifier engine checks four fields to verify whether the response from the test
has a value for which the JSON path matches the given field, is of the same type as the one
defined in the response body, and passes the following check (based on the method being called):</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>For <literal>$.valueWithTypeMatch</literal>, the engine checks whether the type is the same.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>For <literal>$.valueWithMin</literal>, the engine check the type and asserts whether the size is greater

</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>In the preceding example, one contract has the <literal>name</literal> field and the other does not. This
leads to generation of two tests that look more or less like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">package org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.tests.com.hello;

import com.example.TestBase;
import com.jayway.jsonpath.DocumentContext;
import com.jayway.jsonpath.JsonPath;
import com.jayway.restassured.module.mockmvc.specification.MockMvcRequestSpecification;
import com.jayway.restassured.response.ResponseOptions;
import org.junit.Test;

import static com.jayway.restassured.module.mockmvc.RestAssuredMockMvc.*;
import static com.toomuchcoding.jsonassert.JsonAssertion.assertThatJson;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

public class V1Test extends TestBase {

	@Test
	public void validate_should_post_a_user() throws Exception {
		// given:
			MockMvcRequestSpecification request = given();

		// when:
			ResponseOptions response = given().spec(request)
					.post("/users/1");

		// then:
			assertThat(response.statusCode()).isEqualTo(200);
	}

	@Test
	public void validate_withList_1() throws Exception {
		// given:

		// when:
			ResponseOptions response = given().spec(request)
					.post("/users/2");

		// then:
			assertThat(response.statusCode()).isEqualTo(200);
	}

}</programlisting>
<simpara>Notice that, for the contract that has the <literal>name</literal> field, the generated test method is named
<literal>validate_should_post_a_user</literal>. For the one that does not have the name, it is called
<literal>validate_withList_1</literal>. It corresponds to the name of the file <literal>WithList.groovy</literal> and the
index of the contract in the list.</simpara>
<simpara>The generated stubs is shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>should post a user.json
1_WithList.json</screen>
<simpara>As you can see, the first file got the <literal>name</literal> parameter from the contract. The second
got the name of the contract file (<literal>WithList.groovy</literal>) prefixed with the index (in this
case, the contract had an index of <literal>1</literal> in the list of contracts in the file).</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>As you can see, it iss much better if you name your contracts because doing so makes
your tests far more meaningful.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_spring_cloud_contract_wiremock">
<title>Spring Cloud Contract WireMock</title>
<simpara>The Spring Cloud Contract WireMock modules let you use <link xl:href="http://wiremock.org">WireMock</link> in a
Spring Boot application. Check out the
<link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/tree/master/samples">samples</link>
for more details.</simpara>
<simpara>If you have a Spring Boot application that uses Tomcat as an embedded server (which is
the default with <literal>spring-boot-starter-web</literal>),  you can add
<literal>spring-cloud-starter-contract-stub-runner</literal> to your classpath and add <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal> in
order to be able to use Wiremock in your tests. Wiremock runs as a stub server and you
can register stub behavior using a Java API or via static JSON declarations as part of
your test. The following code shows an example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@AutoConfigureWireMock(port = 0)
public class WiremockForDocsTests {
	// A service that calls out over HTTP
	@Autowired private Service service;

	// Using the WireMock APIs in the normal way:
	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		// Stubbing WireMock
		stubFor(get(urlEqualTo("/resource"))
				.willReturn(aResponse().withHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain").withBody("Hello World!")));
		// We're asserting if WireMock responded properly
		assertThat(this.service.go()).isEqualTo("Hello World!");
	}

}</programlisting>
<simpara>To start the stub server on a different port use (for example),
<literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock(port=9999)</literal>. For a random port, use a value of <literal>0</literal>. The stub
server port can be bound in the test application context with the "wiremock.server.port"
property. Using <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal> adds a bean of type <literal>WiremockConfiguration</literal> to
your test application context, where it will be cached in between methods and classes
having the same context, the same as for Spring integration tests.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_registering_stubs_automatically">
<title>Registering Stubs Automatically</title>
<simpara>If you use <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal>, it registers WireMock JSON stubs from the file
system or classpath (by default, from <literal>file:src/test/resources/mappings</literal>). You can
customize the locations using the <literal>stubs</literal> attribute in the annotation, which can be an
Ant-style resource pattern or a directory. In the case of a directory, <literal><emphasis role="strong">*/</emphasis>.json</literal> is
appended. The following code shows an example:</simpara>
<screen>@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureWireMock(stubs="classpath:/stubs")
public class WiremockImportApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private Service service;

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		assertThat(this.service.go()).isEqualTo("Hello World!");
	}

}</screen>
<note>
<simpara>Actually, WireMock always loads mappings from <literal>src/test/resources/mappings</literal> <emphasis role="strong">as
well as</emphasis> the custom locations in the stubs attribute. To change this behavior, you can
also specify a files root as described in the next section of this document.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_using_files_to_specify_the_stub_bodies">
<title>Using Files to Specify the Stub Bodies</title>
<simpara>WireMock can read response bodies from files on the classpath or the file system. In that
case, you can see in the JSON DSL that the response has a <literal>bodyFileName</literal> instead of a
(literal) <literal>body</literal>. The files are resolved relative to a root directory (by default,
<literal>src/test/resources/__files</literal>). To customize this location you can set the <literal>files</literal>
attribute in the <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal> annotation to the location of the parent
directory (in other words, <literal>__files</literal> is a subdirectory). You can use Spring resource
notation to refer to <literal>file:&#8230;&#8203;</literal> or <literal>classpath:&#8230;&#8203;</literal> locations. Generic URLs are not
supported. A list of values can be given, in which case WireMock resolves the first file
that exists when it needs to find a response body.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>When you configure the <literal>files</literal> root, it also affects the
automatic loading of stubs, because they come from the root location
in a subdirectory called "mappings". The value of <literal>files</literal> has no
effect on the stubs loaded explicitly from the <literal>stubs</literal> attribute.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_alternative_using_junit_rules">
<title>Alternative: Using JUnit Rules</title>
<simpara>For a more conventional WireMock experience, you can use JUnit <literal>@Rules</literal> to start and stop
the server. To do so, use the <literal>WireMockSpring</literal> convenience class to obtain an <literal>Options</literal>
instance, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
public class WiremockForDocsClassRuleTests {

	// Start WireMock on some dynamic port
	// for some reason `dynamicPort()` is not working properly
	@ClassRule
	public static WireMockClassRule wiremock = new WireMockClassRule(
			WireMockSpring.options().dynamicPort());
	// A service that calls out over HTTP to localhost:${wiremock.port}
	@Autowired
	private Service service;

	// Using the WireMock APIs in the normal way:
	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		// Stubbing WireMock
		wiremock.stubFor(get(urlEqualTo("/resource"))
				.willReturn(aResponse().withHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain").withBody("Hello World!")));
		// We're asserting if WireMock responded properly
		assertThat(this.service.go()).isEqualTo("Hello World!");
	}

}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>@ClassRule</literal> means that the server shuts down after all the methods in this class
have been run.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_relaxed_ssl_validation_for_rest_template">
<title>Relaxed SSL Validation for Rest Template</title>
<simpara>WireMock lets you stub a "secure" server with an "https" URL protocol. If your
application wants to contact that stub server in an integration test, it will find that
the SSL certificates are not valid (the usual problem with self-installed certificates).
The best option is often to re-configure the client to use "http". If that&#8217;s not an
option, you can ask Spring to configure an HTTP client that ignores SSL validation errors
(do so only for tests, of course).</simpara>
<simpara>To make this work with minimum fuss, you need to be using the Spring Boot
<literal>RestTemplateBuilder</literal> in your app, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public RestTemplate restTemplate(RestTemplateBuilder builder) {
	return builder.build();
}</programlisting>
<simpara>You need <literal>RestTemplateBuilder</literal> because the builder is passed through callbacks to
initialize it, so the SSL validation can be set up in the client at that point. This
happens automatically in your test if you are using the <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal>
annotation or the stub runner. If you use the JUnit <literal>@Rule</literal> approach, you need to add the
<literal>@AutoConfigureHttpClient</literal> annotation as well, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest("app.baseUrl=https://localhost:6443")
@AutoConfigureHttpClient
public class WiremockHttpsServerApplicationTests {

	@ClassRule
	public static WireMockClassRule wiremock = new WireMockClassRule(
			WireMockSpring.options().httpsPort(6443));
...
}</programlisting>
<simpara>If you are using <literal>spring-boot-starter-test</literal>, you have the Apache HTTP client on the
classpath and it is selected by the <literal>RestTemplateBuilder</literal> and configured to ignore SSL
errors. If you use the default <literal>java.net</literal> client, you do not need the annotation (but it
won&#8217;t do any harm). There is no support currently for other clients, but it may be added
in future releases.</simpara>
<simpara>To disable the custom <literal>RestTemplateBuilder</literal>, set the <literal>wiremock.rest-template-ssl-enabled</literal>
property to <literal>false</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_wiremock_and_spring_mvc_mocks">
<title>WireMock and Spring MVC Mocks</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract provides a convenience class that can load JSON WireMock stubs into
a Spring <literal>MockRestServiceServer</literal>. The following code shows an example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.NONE)
public class WiremockForDocsMockServerApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private RestTemplate restTemplate;

	@Autowired
	private Service service;

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		// will read stubs classpath
		MockRestServiceServer server = WireMockRestServiceServer.with(this.restTemplate)
				.baseUrl("http://example.org").stubs("classpath:/stubs/resource.json")
				.build();
		// We're asserting if WireMock responded properly
		assertThat(this.service.go()).isEqualTo("Hello World");
		server.verify();
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>baseUrl</literal> value is prepended to all mock calls, and the <literal>stubs()</literal> method takes a stub
path resource pattern as an argument. In the preceding example, the stub defined at
<literal>/stubs/resource.json</literal> is loaded into the mock server. If the <literal>RestTemplate</literal> is asked to
visit <literal><link xl:href="http://example.org/">http://example.org/</link></literal>, it gets the responses as being declared at that URL. More
than one stub pattern can be specified, and each one can be a directory (for a recursive
list of all ".json"), a fixed filename (as in the example above), or an Ant-style
pattern. The JSON format is the normal WireMock format, which you can read about in the
<link xl:href="http://wiremock.org/docs/stubbing/">WireMock website</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>Currently, the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier supports Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow as
Spring Boot embedded servers, and Wiremock itself has "native" support for a particular
version of Jetty (currently 9.2). To use the native Jetty, you need to add the native
Wiremock dependencies and exclude the Spring Boot container (if there is one).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_customization_of_wiremock_configuration">
<title>Customization of WireMock configuration</title>
<simpara>You can register a bean of <literal>org.springframework.cloud.contract.wiremock.WireMockConfigurationCustomizer</literal> type
in order to customize the WireMock configuration (e.g. add custom transformers).
Example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">		@Bean WireMockConfigurationCustomizer optionsCustomizer() {
			return new WireMockConfigurationCustomizer() {
				@Override public void customize(WireMockConfiguration options) {
// perform your customization here

<section xml:id="_generating_stubs_using_rest_docs">
<title>Generating Stubs using REST Docs</title>
<simpara><link xl:href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-restdocs">Spring REST Docs</link> can be used to generate
documentation (for example in Asciidoctor format) for an HTTP API with Spring MockMvc
or <literal>WebTestClient</literal> or
Rest Assured. At the same time that you generate documentation for your API, you can also
generate WireMock stubs by using Spring Cloud Contract WireMock. To do so, write your
normal REST Docs test cases and use <literal>@AutoConfigureRestDocs</literal> to have stubs be
automatically generated in the REST Docs output directory. The following code shows an
example using <literal>MockMvc</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureRestDocs(outputDir = "target/snippets")
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
public class ApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private MockMvc mockMvc;

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		mockMvc.perform(get("/resource"))
				.andExpect(content().string("Hello World"))
				.andDo(document("resource"));
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>This test generates a WireMock stub at "target/snippets/stubs/resource.json". It matches
all GET requests to the "/resource" path. The same example with <literal>WebTestClient</literal> (used
for testing Spring WebFlux applications) would look like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureRestDocs(outputDir = "target/snippets")
@AutoConfigureWebTestClient
public class ApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private WebTestClient client;

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		client.get().uri("/resource").exchange()
				.expectBody(String.class).isEqualTo("Hello World")
 				.consumeWith(document("resource"));
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Without any additional configuration, these tests create a stub with a request matcher
for the HTTP method and all headers except "host" and "content-length". To match the
request more precisely (for example, to match the body of a POST or PUT), we need to
explicitly create a request matcher. Doing so has two effects:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Creating a stub that matches only in the way you specify.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Asserting that the request in the test case also matches the same conditions.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The main entry point for this feature is <literal>WireMockRestDocs.verify()</literal>, which can be used
as a substitute for the <literal>document()</literal> convenience method, as shown in the following
example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">import static org.springframework.cloud.contract.wiremock.restdocs.WireMockRestDocs.verify;</programlisting>
<screen>@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureRestDocs(outputDir = "target/snippets")
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
public class ApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private MockMvc mockMvc;

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		mockMvc.perform(post("/resource")
                .content("{\"id\":\"123456\",\"message\":\"Hello World\"}"))
				.andExpect(status().isOk())
				.andDo(verify().jsonPath("$.id")
                        .stub("resource"));
	}
}</screen>
<simpara>This contract specifies that any valid POST with an "id" field receives the response
defined in this test. You can chain together calls to <literal>.jsonPath()</literal> to add additional
matchers. If JSON Path is unfamiliar, The <link xl:href="https://github.com/jayway/JsonPath">JayWay
documentation</link> can help you get up to speed. The <literal>WebTestClient</literal> version of this test
has a similar <literal>verify()</literal> static helper that you insert in the same place.</simpara>
<simpara>Instead of the <literal>jsonPath</literal> and <literal>contentType</literal> convenience methods, you can also use the
WireMock APIs to verify that the request matches the created stub, as shown in the
following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Test
public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
	mockMvc.perform(post("/resource")
               .content("{\"id\":\"123456\",\"message\":\"Hello World\"}"))
			.andExpect(status().isOk())
			.andDo(verify()
					.wiremock(WireMock.post(
						urlPathEquals("/resource"))
						.withRequestBody(matchingJsonPath("$.id"))
                       .stub("post-resource"));
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The WireMock API is rich. You can match headers, query parameters, and request body by
regex as well as by JSON path. These features can be used to create stubs with a wider
range of parameters. The above example generates a stub resembling the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>post-resource.json</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
  "request" : {
    "url" : "/resource",
    "method" : "POST",
    "bodyPatterns" : [ {
      "matchesJsonPath" : "$.id"
    }]
  },
  "response" : {
    "status" : 200,
    "body" : "Hello World",
    "headers" : {
      "X-Application-Context" : "application:-1",
      "Content-Type" : "text/plain"
    }
  }
}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<note>
<simpara>You can use either the <literal>wiremock()</literal> method or the <literal>jsonPath()</literal> and <literal>contentType()</literal>
methods to create request matchers, but you can&#8217;t use both approaches.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>On the consumer side, you can make the <literal>resource.json</literal> generated earlier in this section
available on the classpath (by
<link xl:href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html#_publishing_stubs_as_jars">publishing
stubs as JARs</link>, for example). After that, you can create a stub using WireMock in a
number of different ways, including by using
<literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock(stubs="classpath:resource.json")</literal>, as described earlier in this
document.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_generating_contracts_by_using_rest_docs">
<title>Generating Contracts by Using REST Docs</title>
<simpara>You can also generate Spring Cloud Contract DSL files and documentation with Spring REST
Docs. If you do so in combination with Spring Cloud WireMock, you get both the contracts
and the stubs.</simpara>
<simpara>Why would you want to use this feature? Some people in the community asked questions
about a situation in which they would like to move to DSL-based contract definition,
but they already have a lot of Spring MVC tests. Using this feature lets you generate
the contract files that you can later modify and move to folders (defined in your
configuration) so that the plugin finds them.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>You might wonder why this functionality is in the WireMock module. The functionality
is there because it makes sense to generate both the contracts and the stubs.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>Consider the following test:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">		this.mockMvc.perform(post("/foo")
					.accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_PDF)
					.accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
					.contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
					.content("{\"foo\": 23, \"bar\" : \"baz\" }"))
				.andExpect(status().isOk())
				.andExpect(content().string("bar"))
				// first WireMock
				.andDo(WireMockRestDocs.verify()
						.jsonPath("$[?(@.foo &gt;= 20)]")
						.jsonPath("$[?(@.bar in ['baz','bazz','bazzz'])]")
						.contentType(MediaType.valueOf("application/json"))
						.stub("shouldGrantABeerIfOldEnough"))
				// then Contract DSL documentation
				.andDo(document("index", SpringCloudContractRestDocs.dslContract()));</programlisting>
<simpara>The preceding test creates the stub presented in the previous section, generating both
the contract and a documentation file.</simpara>
<simpara>The contract is called <literal>index.groovy</literal> and might look like the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">import org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract

<title>Migrations</title>
<simpara>This section covers migrating from one version of Spring Cloud Contract Verifier to the
next version. It covers the following versions upgrade paths:</simpara>
<section xml:id="cloud-verifier-1.0-1.1">
<title>1.0.x &#8594; 1.1.x</title>
<simpara>This section covers upgrading from version 1.0 to version 1.1.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_new_structure_of_generated_stubs">
<title>New structure of generated stubs</title>
<simpara>In <literal>1.1.x</literal> we have introduced a change to the structure of generated stubs. If you have
been using the  <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal> notation to use the stubs from the classpath,
it no longer works. The following example shows how the <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal> notation
used to work:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@AutoConfigureWireMock(stubs = "classpath:/customer-stubs/mappings", port = 8084)</programlisting>
<simpara>You must either change the location of the stubs to:
<literal>classpath:&#8230;&#8203;/META-INF/groupId/artifactId/version/mappings</literal> or use the new
classpath-based <literal>@AutoConfigureStubRunner</literal>, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@AutoConfigureWireMock(stubs = "classpath:customer-stubs/META-INF/travel.components/customer-contract/1.0.2-SNAPSHOT/mappings/", port = 8084)</programlisting>
<simpara>If you do not want to use <literal>@AutoConfigureStubRunner</literal> and you want to remain with the old
structure, set your plugin tasks accordingly. The following example would work for the
structure presented in the previous snippet.</simpara>

<simpara>Spring Cloud Vault Config provides client-side support for externalized configuration in a distributed system. With <link xl:href="https://www.vaultproject.io">HashiCorp&#8217;s Vault</link> you have a central place to manage external secret properties for applications across all environments. Vault can manage static and dynamic secrets such as username/password for remote applications/resources and provide credentials for external services such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Apache Cassandra, MongoDB, Consul, AWS and more.</simpara>

<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ src/test/bash/create_certificates.sh</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara><literal>create_certificates.sh</literal> creates certificates in <literal>work/ca</literal> and a JKS truststore <literal>work/keystore.jks</literal>. If you want to run Spring Cloud Vault using this quickstart guide you need to configure the truststore the <literal>spring.cloud.vault.ssl.trust-store</literal> property to <literal>file:work/keystore.jks</literal>.</simpara>

<simpara xml:id="quickstart.vault.start"><emphasis role="strong">Start Vault server</emphasis></simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ src/test/bash/local_run_vault.sh</programlisting>
<simpara>Vault is started listening on <literal>0.0.0.0:8200</literal> using the <literal>inmem</literal> storage and
<literal>https</literal>.
Vault is sealed and not initialized when starting up.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>If you want to run tests, leave Vault uninitialized. The tests will
initialize Vault and create a root token <literal>00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>If you want to use Vault for your application or give it a try then you need to initialize it first.</simpara>

Initial Root Token: 19aefa97-cccc-bbbb-aaaa-225940e63d76

Vault initialized with 5 keys and a key threshold of 3. Please
securely distribute the above keys. When the Vault is re-sealed,
restarted, or stopped, you must provide at least 3 of these keys
to unseal it again.

Vault does not store the master key. Without at least 3 keys,
your Vault will remain permanently sealed.</programlisting>
<simpara>Vault will initialize and return a set of unsealing keys and the root token.
Pick 3 keys and unseal Vault. Store the Vault token in the <literal>VAULT_TOKEN</literal>
 environment variable.</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ vault unseal (Key 1)
$ vault unseal (Key 2)

<simpara>Spring Cloud Vault accesses different resources. By default, the secret
backend is enabled which accesses secret config settings via JSON endpoints.</simpara>
<simpara>The HTTP service has resources in the form:</simpara>
<screen>/secret/{application}/{profile}
/secret/{application}
/secret/{defaultContext}/{profile}
/secret/{defaultContext}</screen>
<simpara>where the "application" is injected as the <literal>spring.application.name</literal> in the
<literal>SpringApplication</literal> (i.e. what is normally "application" in a regular
Spring Boot app), "profile" is an active profile (or comma-separated
list of properties). Properties retrieved from Vault will be used "as-is"
without further prefixing of the property names.</simpara>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_client_side_usage_2">
<title>Client Side Usage</title>
<simpara>To use these features in an application, just build it as a Spring
Boot application that depends on <literal>spring-cloud-vault-config</literal> (e.g. see
the test cases). Example Maven configuration:</simpara>
<example>
<title>pom.xml</title>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;parent&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-parent&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.5.4.RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;relativePath /&gt; &lt;!-- lookup parent from repository --&gt;
&lt;/parent&gt;

&lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-starter-vault-config&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;1.3.5.BUILD-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-test&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;/dependencies&gt;

&lt;build&gt;
    &lt;plugins&gt;
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;/plugin&gt;
    &lt;/plugins&gt;
&lt;/build&gt;

&lt;!-- repositories also needed for snapshots and milestones --&gt;</programlisting>
</example>
<simpara>Then you can create a standard Spring Boot application, like this simple HTTP server:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class Application {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<simpara>When it runs it will pick up the external configuration from the
default local Vault server on port <literal>8200</literal> if it is running. To modify
the startup behavior you can change the location of the Vault server
using <literal>bootstrap.properties</literal> (like <literal>application.properties</literal> but for
the bootstrap phase of an application context), e.g.</simpara>
<example>
<title>bootstrap.yml</title>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.cloud.vault:
    host: localhost
    port: 8200
    scheme: https
    uri: https://localhost:8200
    connection-timeout: 5000
    read-timeout: 15000
    config:
        order: -10</programlisting>
</example>
<itemizedlist>

for SSL certificate validation</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>port</literal> sets the Vault port</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>scheme</literal> setting the scheme to <literal>http</literal> will use plain HTTP.
Supported schemes are <literal>http</literal> and <literal>https</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>uri</literal> configure the Vault endpoint with an URI. Takes precedence over host/port/scheme configuration</simpara>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>config.order</literal> sets the order for the property source</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Enabling further integrations requires additional dependencies and
configuration. Depending on how you have set up Vault you might need
additional configuration like
<link xl:href="http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-vault/spring-cloud-vault.html#vault.config.ssl">SSL</link> and
<link xl:href="http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-vault/spring-cloud-vault.html#vault.config.authentication">authentication</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>If the application imports the <literal>spring-boot-starter-actuator</literal> project, the
status of the vault server will be available via the <literal>/health</literal> endpoint.</simpara>
<simpara>The vault health indicator can be enabled or disabled through the
property <literal>health.vault.enabled</literal> (default <literal>true</literal>).</simpara>

<warning>
<simpara>Consider carefully your security requirements. Static token authentication is fine if you want quickly get started with Vault, but a static token is not protected any further. Any disclosure to unintended parties allows Vault use with the associated token roles.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="vault.config.authentication">
<title>Authentication methods</title>
<simpara>Different organizations have different requirements for security
and authentication. Vault reflects that need by shipping multiple authentication
methods. Spring Cloud Vault supports token and AppId authentication.</simpara>
<section xml:id="vault.config.authentication.token">
<title>Token authentication</title>
<simpara>Tokens are the core method for authentication within Vault.
Token authentication requires a static token to be provided using the

<simpara>Vault supports <link xl:href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/app-id.html">AppId</link>
authentication that consists of two hard to guess tokens. The AppId
defaults to <literal>spring.application.name</literal> that is statically configured.
The second token is the UserId which is a part determined by the application,
usually related to the runtime environment. IP address, Mac address or a
Docker container name are good examples. Spring Cloud Vault Config supports
IP address, Mac address and static UserId&#8217;s (e.g. supplied via System properties).
The IP and Mac address are represented as Hex-encoded SHA256 hash.</simpara>
<simpara>IP address-based UserId&#8217;s use the local host&#8217;s IP address.</simpara>
<example>

<title>Custom UserId</title>
<simpara>The UserId generation is an open mechanism. You can set
<literal>spring.cloud.vault.app-id.user-id</literal> to any string and the configured
value will be used as static UserId.</simpara>
<simpara>A more advanced approach lets you set <literal>spring.cloud.vault.app-id.user-id</literal> to a
classname. This class must be on your classpath and must implement
the <literal>org.springframework.cloud.vault.AppIdUserIdMechanism</literal> interface
and the <literal>createUserId</literal> method. Spring Cloud Vault will obtain the UserId
by calling <literal>createUserId</literal> each time it authenticates using AppId to
obtain a token.</simpara>

<title>AWS-EC2 authentication</title>
<simpara>The <link xl:href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws-ec2.html">aws-ec2</link>
auth backend provides a secure introduction mechanism
for AWS EC2 instances, allowing automated retrieval of a Vault
token. Unlike most Vault authentication backends, this backend
does not require first-deploying, or provisioning security-sensitive
credentials (tokens, username/password, client certificates, etc.).
Instead, it treats AWS as a Trusted Third Party and uses the
cryptographically signed dynamic metadata information that uniquely
represents each EC2 instance.</simpara>
<example>
<title>bootstrap.yml using AWS-EC2 Authentication</title>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.cloud.vault:
    authentication: AWS_EC2</programlisting>
</example>
<simpara>AWS-EC2 authentication enables nonce by default to follow
the Trust On First Use (TOFU) principle. Any unintended party that
gains access to the PKCS#7 identity metadata can authenticate
against Vault.</simpara>
<simpara>During the first login, Spring Cloud Vault generates a nonce
that is stored in the auth backend aside the instance Id.
Re-authentication requires the same nonce to be sent. Any other
party does not have the nonce and can raise an alert in Vault for
further investigation.</simpara>
<simpara>The nonce is kept in memory and is lost during application restart.
You can configure a static nonce with <literal>spring.cloud.vault.aws-ec2.nonce</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>AWS-EC2 authentication roles are optional and default to the AMI.
You can configure the authentication role by setting the
<literal>spring.cloud.vault.aws-ec2.role</literal> property.</simpara>

<title>AWS-IAM authentication</title>
<simpara>The <link xl:href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws-ec2.html">aws</link> backend provides a secure
authentication mechanism for AWS IAM roles, allowing the automatic authentication with
vault based on the current IAM role of the running application.
 Unlike most Vault authentication backends, this backend
does not require first-deploying, or provisioning security-sensitive
credentials (tokens, username/password, client certificates, etc.).
Instead, it treats AWS as a Trusted Third Party and uses the
4 pieces of information signed by the caller with their IAM credentials
 to verify that the caller is indeed using that IAM role.</simpara>
<simpara>The current IAM role the application is running in is automatically calculated.
If you are running your application on AWS ECS then the application
will use the IAM role assigned to the ECS task of the running container.
If you are running your application naked on top of an EC2 instance then
the IAM role used will be the one assigned to the EC2 instance.</simpara>
<simpara>When using the AWS-IAM authentication you must create a role in Vault

services that need to access a database no longer need to configure
credentials: they can request them from Vault, and use Vault&#8217;s leasing
mechanism to more easily roll keys.</simpara>

<title>Configure <literal>PropertySourceLocator</literal> behavior</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Vault uses property-based configuration to create <literal>PropertySource</literal>s
for generic and discovered secret backends.</simpara>
<simpara>Discovered backends provide <literal>VaultSecretBackendDescriptor</literal> beans to describe the configuration
state to use secret backend as <literal>PropertySource</literal>. A <literal>SecretBackendMetadataFactory</literal> is required
to create a <literal>SecretBackendMetadata</literal> object which contains path, name and property transformation
configuration.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>SecretBackendMetadata</literal> is used to back a particular <literal>PropertySource</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>You can register an arbitrary number of beans implementing <literal>VaultConfigurer</literal> for customization.
Default generic and discovered backend registration is disabled if Spring Cloud Vault discovers
at least one <literal>VaultConfigurer</literal> bean. You can however enable default registration with
<literal>SecretBackendConfigurer.registerDefaultGenericSecretBackends()</literal> and <literal>SecretBackendConfigurer.registerDefaultDiscoveredSecretBackends()</literal>.</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public class CustomizationBean implements VaultConfigurer {

    @Override
    public void addSecretBackends(SecretBackendConfigurer configurer) {

        configurer.add("secret/my-application");

        configurer.registerDefaultGenericSecretBackends(false);
        configurer.registerDefaultDiscoveredSecretBackends(true);
    }
}</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<note>
<simpara>All customization is required to happen in the bootstrap context. Add your configuration
classes to <literal>META-INF/spring.factories</literal> at <literal>org.springframework.cloud.bootstrap.BootstrapConfiguration</literal>

</note>

<chapter xml:id="_service_registry_configuration">
<title>Service Registry Configuration</title>
<simpara>You can use a <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> (such as from Spring Cloud Consul) to locate
a Vault server by setting spring.cloud.vault.discovery.enabled=true (default <literal>false</literal>).
The net result of that is that your apps need a bootstrap.yml (or an environment variable)
with the appropriate discovery configuration.
The benefit is that the Vault can change its co-ordinates, as long as the discovery service
is a fixed point. The default service id is <literal>vault</literal> but you can change that on the client with
<literal>spring.cloud.vault.discovery.serviceId</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>The discovery client implementations all support some kind of metadata map
(e.g. for Eureka we have eureka.instance.metadataMap). Some additional properties of the service
may need to be configured in its service registration metadata so that clients can connect
correctly. Service registries that do not provide details about transport layer security
need to provide a <literal>scheme</literal> metadata entry to be set either to <literal>https</literal> or <literal>http</literal>.
If no scheme is configured and the service is not exposed as secure service, then
configuration defaults to <literal>spring.cloud.vault.scheme</literal> which is <literal>https</literal> when it&#8217;s not set.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="vault-lease-renewal">
<title>Lease lifecycle management (renewal and revocation)</title>
<simpara>With every secret, Vault creates a lease:
metadata containing information such as a time duration,
renewability, and more.</simpara>
<simpara>Vault promises that the data will be valid for the given duration,
or Time To Live (TTL). Once the lease is expired, Vault can
revoke the data, and the consumer of the secret can no longer
be certain that it is valid.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Vault maintains a lease lifecycle beyond
the creation of login tokens and secrets. That said,
login tokens and secrets associated with a lease
are scheduled for renewal just before the lease expires
until terminal expiry.
Application shutdown revokes obtained login tokens and renewable
leases.</simpara>
<simpara>Secret service and database backends (such as MongoDB or MySQL)
usually generate a renewable lease so generated credentials will
be disabled on application shutdown.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Static tokens are not renewed or revoked.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Lease renewal and revocation is enabled by default and can
be disabled by setting <literal>spring.cloud.vault.config.lifecycle.enabled</literal>
to <literal>false</literal>. This is not recommended as leases can expire and
Spring Cloud Vault cannot longer access Vault or services
using generated credentials and valid credentials remain active
after application shutdown.</simpara>

<simpara>Clients make requests to Spring Cloud Gateway. If the Gateway Handler Mapping determines that a request matches a Route, it is sent to the Gateway Web Handler. This handler runs sends the request through a filter chain that is specific to the request. The reason the filters are divided by the dotted line, is that filters may execute logic before the proxy request is sent or after. All "pre" filter logic is executed, then the proxy request is made. After the proxy request is made, the "post" filter logic is executed.</simpara>

<simpara>URIs defined in routes without a port will get a default port set to 80 and 443 for HTTP and HTTPS URIs respectively.</simpara>

<title>Building a Simple Gateway Using Spring MVC</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Gateway provides a utility object called <literal>ProxyExchange</literal> which you can use inside a regular Spring MVC handler as a method parameter. It supports basic downstream HTTP exchanges via methods that mirror the HTTP verbs, or forwarding to a local handler via the <literal>forward()</literal> method.</simpara>
<simpara>Example (proxying a request to "/test" downstream to a remote server):</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RestController
@SpringBootApplication
public class GatewaySampleApplication {

	@Value("${remote.home}")
	private URI home;

	@GetMapping("/test")
	public ResponseEntity&lt;?&gt; proxy(ProxyExchange&lt;Object&gt; proxy) throws Exception {
		return proxy.uri(home.toString() + "/image/png").get();
	}

}</programlisting>
<simpara>There are convenience methods on the <literal>ProxyExchange</literal> to enable the handler method to discover and enhance the URI path of the incoming request. For example you might want to extract the trailing elements of a path to pass them downstream:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@GetMapping("/proxy/path/**")
public ResponseEntity&lt;?&gt; proxyPath(ProxyExchange&lt;?&gt; proxy) throws Exception {
  String path = proxy.path("/proxy/path/");
  return proxy.uri(home.toString() + "/foos/" + path).get();
}</programlisting>
<simpara>All the features of Spring MVC are available to Gateway handler methods. So you can inject request headers and query parameters, for instance, and you can constrain the incoming requests with declarations in the mapping annotation. See the documentation for <literal>@RequestMapping</literal> in Spring MVC for more details of those features.</simpara>
<simpara>Headers can be added to the downstream response using the <literal>header()</literal> methods on <literal>ProxyExchange</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>You can also manipulate response headers (and anything else you like in the response) by adding a mapper to the <literal>get()</literal> etc. method. The mapper is a <literal>Function</literal> that takes the incoming <literal>ResponseEntity</literal> and converts it to an outgoing one.</simpara>
<simpara>First class support is provided for "sensitive" headers ("cookie" and "authorization" by default) which are not passed downstream, and for "proxy" headers (<literal>x-forwarded-*</literal>).</simpara>

 v1. In zipkin v1, only equals filters are supported. Dropping query parameters
 makes the number of distinct URIs less. For example, one can query for the same
 resource, regardless of signing parameters encoded in the query line. This does
 not reduce cardinality to a HTTP single route. For example, it is common to
 express a route as an http URI template like "/resource/{resource_id}". In
 systems where only equals queries are available, searching for
 {@code http.uri=/resource} won&#8217;t match if the actual request was
 "/resource/abcd-ff". Historical note: This was commonly expressed as "http.uri"
 in zipkin, eventhough it was most often just a path.</simpara></entry>
