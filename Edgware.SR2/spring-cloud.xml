<simpara>Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of
the common patterns in distributed systems (e.g. configuration
management, service discovery, circuit breakers, intelligent routing,
micro-proxy, control bus). Coordination of
distributed systems leads to boiler plate patterns, and using Spring
Cloud developers can quickly stand up services and applications that
implement those patterns. They will work well in any distributed
environment, including the developer&#8217;s own laptop, bare metal data
centres, and managed platforms such as Cloud Foundry.</simpara>

<partintro>
<simpara><link xl:href="http://pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/migrating-to-cloud-native-application-architectures-ebook">Cloud Native</link> is a style of application development that encourages easy adoption of best practices in the areas of continuous delivery and value-driven development. A related discipline is that of building <link xl:href="http://12factor.net/">12-factor Apps</link> in which development practices are aligned with delivery and operations goals, for instance by using declarative programming and management and monitoring. Spring Cloud facilitates these styles of development in a number of specific ways and the starting point is a set of features that all components in a distributed system either need or need easy access to when required.</simpara>
<simpara>Many of those features are covered by <link xl:href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot">Spring Boot</link>, which we build on in Spring Cloud. Some more are delivered by Spring Cloud as two libraries: Spring Cloud Context and Spring Cloud Commons. Spring Cloud Context provides utilities and special services for the <literal>ApplicationContext</literal> of a Spring Cloud application (bootstrap context, encryption, refresh scope and environment endpoints). Spring Cloud Commons is a set of abstractions and common classes used in different Spring Cloud implementations (eg. Spring Cloud Netflix vs. Spring Cloud Consul).</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_spring_cloud_context_application_context_services">
<title>Spring Cloud Context: Application Context Services</title>
<simpara>Spring Boot has an opinionated view of how to build an application
with Spring: for instance it has conventional locations for common
configuration file, and endpoints for common management and monitoring
tasks. Spring Cloud builds on top of that and adds a few features that
probably all components in a system would use or occasionally need.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_the_bootstrap_application_context">
<title>The Bootstrap Application Context</title>
<simpara>A Spring Cloud application operates by creating a "bootstrap"
context, which is a parent context for the main application. Out of
the box it is responsible for loading configuration properties from
the external sources, and also decrypting properties in the local
external configuration files. The two contexts share an <literal>Environment</literal>
which is the source of external properties for any Spring
application. Bootstrap properties are added with high precedence, so
they cannot be overridden by local configuration, by default.</simpara>
<simpara>The bootstrap context uses a different convention for locating
external configuration than the main application context, so instead
of <literal>application.yml</literal> (or <literal>.properties</literal>) you use <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal>,
keeping the external configuration for bootstrap and main context
nicely separate. Example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>bootstrap.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>spring:
  application:
    name: foo
  cloud:
    config:
      uri: ${SPRING_CONFIG_URI:http://localhost:8888}</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>It is a good idea to set the <literal>spring.application.name</literal> (in
<literal>bootstrap.yml</literal> or <literal>application.yml</literal>) if your application needs any
application-specific configuration from the server.</simpara>
<simpara>You can disable the bootstrap process completely by setting
<literal>spring.cloud.bootstrap.enabled=false</literal> (e.g. in System properties).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_application_context_hierarchies">
<title>Application Context Hierarchies</title>
<simpara>If you build an application context from <literal>SpringApplication</literal> or
<literal>SpringApplicationBuilder</literal>, then the Bootstrap context is added as a
parent to that context. It is a feature of Spring that child contexts
inherit property sources and profiles from their parent, so the "main"
application context will contain additional property sources, compared
to building the same context without Spring Cloud Config. The
additional property sources are:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>"bootstrap": an optional <literal>CompositePropertySource</literal> appears with high
priority if any <literal>PropertySourceLocators</literal> are found in the Bootstrap
context, and they have non-empty properties. An example would be
properties from the Spring Cloud Config Server. See
<link xl:href="#customizing-bootstrap-property-sources">below</link> for instructions
on how to customize the contents of this property source.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>"applicationConfig: [classpath:bootstrap.yml]" (and friends if
Spring profiles are active). If you have a <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal> (or
properties) then those properties are used to configure the Bootstrap
context, and then they get added to the child context when its parent
is set. They have lower precedence than the <literal>application.yml</literal> (or
properties) and any other property sources that are added to the child
as a normal part of the process of creating a Spring Boot
application. See <link xl:href="#customizing-bootstrap-properties">below</link> for
instructions on how to customize the contents of these property
sources.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Because of the ordering rules of property sources the "bootstrap"
entries take precedence, but note that these do not contain any data
from <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal>, which has very low precedence, but can be used
to set defaults.</simpara>
<simpara>You can extend the context hierarchy by simply setting the parent
context of any <literal>ApplicationContext</literal> you create, e.g. using its own
interface, or with the <literal>SpringApplicationBuilder</literal> convenience methods
(<literal>parent()</literal>, <literal>child()</literal> and <literal>sibling()</literal>). The bootstrap context will be
the parent of the most senior ancestor that you create yourself.
Every context in the hierarchy will have its own "bootstrap" property
source (possibly empty) to avoid promoting values inadvertently from
parents down to their descendants.  Every context in the hierarchy can
also (in principle) have a different <literal>spring.application.name</literal> and
hence a different remote property source if there is a Config
Server. Normal Spring application context behaviour rules apply to
property resolution: properties from a child context override those in
the parent, by name and also by property source name (if the child has
a property source with the same name as the parent, the one from the
parent is not included in the child).</simpara>
<simpara>Note that the <literal>SpringApplicationBuilder</literal> allows you to share an
<literal>Environment</literal> amongst the whole hierarchy, but that is not the
default. Thus, sibling contexts in particular do not need to have the
same profiles or property sources, even though they will share common
things with their parent.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="customizing-bootstrap-properties">
<title>Changing the Location of Bootstrap Properties</title>
<simpara>The <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal> (or <literal>.properties</literal>) location can be specified using
<literal>spring.cloud.bootstrap.name</literal> (default "bootstrap") or
<literal>spring.cloud.bootstrap.location</literal> (default empty), e.g. in System
properties. Those properties behave like the <literal>spring.config.*</literal>
variants with the same name, in fact they are used to set up the
bootstrap <literal>ApplicationContext</literal> by setting those properties in its
<literal>Environment</literal>. If there is an active profile (from
<literal>spring.profiles.active</literal> or through the <literal>Environment</literal> API in the
context you are building) then properties in that profile will be
loaded as well, just like in a regular Spring Boot app, e.g. from
<literal>bootstrap-development.properties</literal> for a "development" profile.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="overriding-bootstrap-properties">
<title>Overriding the Values of Remote Properties</title>
<simpara>The property sources that are added to you application by the
bootstrap context are often "remote" (e.g. from a Config Server), and
by default they cannot be overridden locally, except on the command
line. If you want to allow your applications to override the remote
properties with their own System properties or config files, the
remote property source has to grant it permission by setting
<literal>spring.cloud.config.allowOverride=true</literal> (it doesn&#8217;t work to set this
locally). Once that flag is set there are some finer grained settings
to control the location of the remote properties in relation to System
properties and the application&#8217;s local configuration:
<literal>spring.cloud.config.overrideNone=true</literal> to override with any local
property source, and
<literal>spring.cloud.config.overrideSystemProperties=false</literal> if only System
properties and env vars should override the remote settings, but not
the local config files.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_customizing_the_bootstrap_configuration">
<title>Customizing the Bootstrap Configuration</title>
<simpara>The bootstrap context can be trained to do anything you like by adding
entries to <literal>/META-INF/spring.factories</literal> under the key
<literal>org.springframework.cloud.bootstrap.BootstrapConfiguration</literal>. This is
a comma-separated list of Spring <literal>@Configuration</literal> classes which will
be used to create the context. Any beans that you want to be available
to the main application context for autowiring can be created here,
and also there is a special contract for <literal>@Beans</literal> of type
<literal>ApplicationContextInitializer</literal>. Classes can be marked with an <literal>@Order</literal>
if you want to control the startup sequence (the default order is
"last").</simpara>
<warning>
<simpara>Be careful when adding custom <literal>BootstrapConfiguration</literal> that the
classes you add are not <literal>@ComponentScanned</literal> by mistake into your
"main" application context, where they might not be needed.
Use a separate package name for boot configuration classes that is
not already covered by your <literal>@ComponentScan</literal> or <literal>@SpringBootApplication</literal>
annotated configuration classes.</simpara>
</warning>
<simpara>The bootstrap process ends by injecting initializers into the main
<literal>SpringApplication</literal> instance (i.e. the normal Spring Boot startup
sequence, whether it is running as a standalone app or deployed in an
application server). First a bootstrap context is created from the
classes found in <literal>spring.factories</literal> and then all <literal>@Beans</literal> of type
<literal>ApplicationContextInitializer</literal> are added to the main
<literal>SpringApplication</literal> before it is started.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="customizing-bootstrap-property-sources">
<title>Customizing the Bootstrap Property Sources</title>
<simpara>The default property source for external configuration added by the
bootstrap process is the Config Server, but you can add additional
sources by adding beans of type <literal>PropertySourceLocator</literal> to the
bootstrap context (via <literal>spring.factories</literal>). You could use this to
insert additional properties from a different server, or from a
database, for instance.</simpara>
<simpara>As an example, consider the following trivial custom locator:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Configuration
public class CustomPropertySourceLocator implements PropertySourceLocator {

    @Override
    public PropertySource&lt;?&gt; locate(Environment environment) {
        return new MapPropertySource("customProperty",
                Collections.&lt;String, Object&gt;singletonMap("property.from.sample.custom.source", "worked as intended"));
    }

}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>Environment</literal> that is passed in is the one for the
<literal>ApplicationContext</literal> about to be created, i.e. the one that we are
supplying additional property sources for. It will already have its
normal Spring Boot-provided property sources, so you can use those to
locate a property source specific to this <literal>Environment</literal> (e.g. by
keying it on the <literal>spring.application.name</literal>, as is done in the default
Config Server property source locator).</simpara>
<simpara>If you create a jar with this class in it and then add a
<literal>META-INF/spring.factories</literal> containing:</simpara>
<screen>org.springframework.cloud.bootstrap.BootstrapConfiguration=sample.custom.CustomPropertySourceLocator</screen>
<simpara>then the "customProperty" <literal>PropertySource</literal> will show up in any
application that includes that jar on its classpath.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_environment_changes">
<title>Environment Changes</title>
<simpara>The application will listen for an <literal>EnvironmentChangeEvent</literal> and react
to the change in a couple of standard ways (additional
<literal>ApplicationListeners</literal> can be added as <literal>@Beans</literal> by the user in the
normal way). When an <literal>EnvironmentChangeEvent</literal> is observed it will
have a list of key values that have changed, and the application will
use those to:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Re-bind any <literal>@ConfigurationProperties</literal> beans in the context</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Set the logger levels for any properties in <literal>logging.level.*</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Note that the Config Client does not by default poll for changes in
the <literal>Environment</literal>, and generally we would not recommend that approach
for detecting changes (although you could set it up with a
<literal>@Scheduled</literal> annotation). If you have a scaled-out client application
then it is better to broadcast the <literal>EnvironmentChangeEvent</literal> to all
the instances instead of having them polling for changes (e.g. using
the <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-bus">Spring Cloud
Bus</link>).</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>EnvironmentChangeEvent</literal> covers a large class of refresh use
cases, as long as you can actually make a change to the <literal>Environment</literal>
and publish the event (those APIs are public and part of core
Spring). You can verify the changes are bound to
<literal>@ConfigurationProperties</literal> beans by visiting the <literal>/configprops</literal>
endpoint (normal Spring Boot Actuator feature). For instance a
<literal>DataSource</literal> can have its <literal>maxPoolSize</literal> changed at runtime (the
default <literal>DataSource</literal> created by Spring Boot is an
<literal>@ConfigurationProperties</literal> bean) and grow capacity
dynamically. Re-binding <literal>@ConfigurationProperties</literal> does not cover
another large class of use cases, where you need more control over the
refresh, and where you need a change to be atomic over the whole
<literal>ApplicationContext</literal>. To address those concerns we have
<literal>@RefreshScope</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_refresh_scope">
<title>Refresh Scope</title>
<simpara>A Spring <literal>@Bean</literal> that is marked as <literal>@RefreshScope</literal> will get special
treatment when there is a configuration change. This addresses the
problem of stateful beans that only get their configuration injected
when they are initialized. For instance if a <literal>DataSource</literal> has open
connections when the database URL is changed via the <literal>Environment</literal>, we
probably want the holders of those connections to be able to complete
what they are doing. Then the next time someone borrows a connection
from the pool he gets one with the new URL.</simpara>
<simpara>Refresh scope beans are lazy proxies that initialize when they are
used (i.e. when a method is called), and the scope acts as a cache of
initialized values. To force a bean to re-initialize on the next
method call you just need to invalidate its cache entry.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>RefreshScope</literal> is a bean in the context and it has a public method
<literal>refreshAll()</literal> to refresh all beans in the scope by clearing the
target cache. There is also a <literal>refresh(String)</literal> method to refresh an
individual bean by name. This functionality is exposed in the
<literal>/refresh</literal> endpoint (over HTTP or JMX).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara><literal>@RefreshScope</literal> works (technically) on an <literal>@Configuration</literal>
class, but it might lead to surprising behaviour: e.g. it does <emphasis role="strong">not</emphasis>
mean that all the <literal>@Beans</literal> defined in that class are themselves
<literal>@RefreshScope</literal>. Specifically, anything that depends on those beans
cannot rely on them being updated when a refresh is initiated, unless
it is itself in <literal>@RefreshScope</literal> (in which it will be rebuilt on a
refresh and its dependencies re-injected, at which point they will be
re-initialized from the refreshed <literal>@Configuration</literal>).</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_encryption_and_decryption">
<title>Encryption and Decryption</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud has an <literal>Environment</literal> pre-processor for decrypting
property values locally. It follows the same rules as the Config
Server, and has the same external configuration via <literal>encrypt.*</literal>. Thus
you can use encrypted values in the form <literal>{cipher}*</literal> and as long as
there is a valid key then they will be decrypted before the main
application context gets the <literal>Environment</literal>. To use the encryption
features in an application you need to include Spring Security RSA in
your classpath (Maven co-ordinates
"org.springframework.security:spring-security-rsa") and you also need
the full strength JCE extensions in your JVM.</simpara>
<simpara>If you are getting an exception due to "Illegal key size" and you are using Sun&#8217;s JDK, you need to install the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files. See the following links for more information:</simpara>

<title>Spring Cloud Commons: Common Abstractions</title>
<simpara>Patterns such as service discovery, load balancing and circuit breakers lend themselves to a common abstraction layer that can be consumed by all Spring Cloud clients, independent of the implementation (e.g. discovery via Eureka or Consul).</simpara>
<section xml:id="__enablediscoveryclient">
<title>@EnableDiscoveryClient</title>
<simpara>Commons provides the <literal>@EnableDiscoveryClient</literal> annotation. This looks for implementations of the <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> interface via <literal>META-INF/spring.factories</literal>. Implementations of Discovery Client will add a configuration class to <literal>spring.factories</literal> under the <literal>org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient</literal> key. Examples of <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> implementations: are <link xl:href="http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/">Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka</link>, <link xl:href="http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-consul/">Spring Cloud Consul Discovery</link> and <link xl:href="http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-zookeeper/">Spring Cloud Zookeeper Discovery</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>By default, implementations of <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> will auto-register the local Spring Boot server with the remote discovery server. This can be disabled by setting <literal>autoRegister=false</literal> in <literal>@EnableDiscoveryClient</literal>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The use of <literal>@EnableDiscoveryClient</literal> is no longer required.  It is enough to just have a <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> implementation
on the classpath to cause the Spring Boot application to register with the service discovery server.</simpara>

<partintro>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Edgware.SR2</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Config provides server and client-side support for externalized configuration in a distributed system. With the Config Server you have a central place to manage external properties for applications across all environments. The concepts on both client and server map identically to the Spring <literal>Environment</literal> and <literal>PropertySource</literal> abstractions, so they fit very well with Spring applications, but can be used with any application running in any language. As an application moves through the deployment pipeline from dev to test and into production you can manage the configuration between those environments and be certain that applications have everything they need to run when they migrate. The default implementation of the server storage backend uses git so it easily supports labelled versions of configuration environments, as well as being accessible to a wide range of tooling for managing the content.  It is easy to add alternative implementations and plug them in with Spring configuration.</simpara>
</partintro>
<chapter xml:id="_quick_start">
<title>Quick Start</title>
<simpara>Start the server:</simpara>
<screen>$ cd spring-cloud-config-server
$ ../mvnw spring-boot:run</screen>
<simpara>The server is a Spring Boot application so you can run it from your
IDE instead if you prefer (the main class is
<literal>ConfigServerApplication</literal>). Then try out a client:</simpara>
<screen>$ curl localhost:8888/foo/development
{"name":"foo","label":"master","propertySources":[
  {"name":"https://github.com/scratches/config-repo/foo-development.properties","source":{"bar":"spam"}},
  {"name":"https://github.com/scratches/config-repo/foo.properties","source":{"foo":"bar"}}
]}</screen>
<simpara>The default strategy for locating property sources is to clone a git
repository (at <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri</literal>) and use it to
initialize a mini <literal>SpringApplication</literal>. The mini-application&#8217;s
<literal>Environment</literal> is used to enumerate property sources and publish them
via a JSON endpoint.</simpara>
<simpara>The HTTP service has resources in the form:</simpara>
<screen>/{application}/{profile}[/{label}]
/{application}-{profile}.yml
/{label}/{application}-{profile}.yml
/{application}-{profile}.properties
/{label}/{application}-{profile}.properties</screen>
<simpara>where the "application" is injected as the <literal>spring.config.name</literal> in the
<literal>SpringApplication</literal> (i.e. what is normally "application" in a regular
Spring Boot app), "profile" is an active profile (or comma-separated
list of properties), and "label" is an optional git label (defaults to
"master".)</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Config Server pulls configuration for remote clients
from a git repository (which must be provided):</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo</programlisting>
<section xml:id="_client_side_usage">
<title>Client Side Usage</title>
<simpara>To use these features in an application, just build it as a Spring
Boot application that depends on spring-cloud-config-client (e.g. see
the test cases for the config-client, or the sample app). The most
convenient way to add the dependency is via a Spring Boot starter
<literal>org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-config</literal>. There is also a
parent pom and BOM (<literal>spring-cloud-starter-parent</literal>) for Maven users and a
Spring IO version management properties file for Gradle and Spring CLI
users. Example Maven configuration:</simpara>

<title>pom.xml</title>

<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">   &lt;parent&gt;
       &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
       &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-parent&lt;/artifactId&gt;
       &lt;version&gt;1.3.5.RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;
       &lt;relativePath /&gt; &lt;!-- lookup parent from repository --&gt;

		&lt;/dependency&gt;
	&lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;

&lt;dependencies&gt;
	&lt;dependency&gt;

	&lt;/plugins&gt;
&lt;/build&gt;

   &lt;!-- repositories also needed for snapshots and milestones --&gt;</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Then you can create a standard Spring Boot application, like this simple HTTP server:</simpara>
<screen>@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class Application {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

}</screen>
<simpara>When it runs it will pick up the external configuration from the
default local config server on port 8888 if it is running. To modify
the startup behaviour you can change the location of the config server
using <literal>bootstrap.properties</literal> (like <literal>application.properties</literal> but for
the bootstrap phase of an application context), e.g.</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.config.uri: http://myconfigserver.com</screen>
<simpara>The bootstrap properties will show up in the <literal>/env</literal> endpoint as a
high-priority property source, e.g.</simpara>
<screen>$ curl localhost:8080/env
{
  "profiles":[],
  "configService:https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo/bar.properties":{"foo":"bar"},
  "servletContextInitParams":{},
  "systemProperties":{...},
  ...
}</screen>
<simpara>(a property source called "configService:&lt;URL of remote
repository&gt;/&lt;file name&gt;" contains the property "foo" with value
"bar" and is highest priority).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>the URL in the property source name is the git repository not
the config server URL.</simpara>
</note>

<chapter xml:id="_spring_cloud_config_server">
<title>Spring Cloud Config Server</title>
<simpara>The Server provides an HTTP, resource-based API for external
configuration (name-value pairs, or equivalent YAML content).  The
server is easily embeddable in a Spring Boot application using the
<literal>@EnableConfigServer</literal> annotation. So this app is a config server:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>ConfigServer.java</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@EnableConfigServer
public class ConfigServer {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(ConfigServer.class, args);
  }
}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Like all Spring Boot apps it runs on port 8080 by default, but you
can switch it to the conventional port 8888 in various ways. The
easiest, which also sets a default configuration repository,
is by launching it with <literal>spring.config.name=configserver</literal> (there
is a <literal>configserver.yml</literal> in the Config Server jar). Another is
to use your own <literal>application.properties</literal>, e.g.</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.properties</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="properties" linenumbering="unnumbered">server.port: 8888
spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri: file://${user.home}/config-repo</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>where <literal>${user.home}/config-repo</literal> is a git repository containing
YAML and properties files.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>in Windows you need an extra "/" in the file URL if it is
absolute with a drive prefix, e.g. <literal><link xl:href="file:///${user.home}/config-repo">file:///${user.home}/config-repo</link></literal>.</simpara>
</note>
<tip>
<simpara>Here&#8217;s a recipe for creating the git repository in the example
above:</simpara>
<screen>$ cd $HOME
$ mkdir config-repo
$ cd config-repo
$ git init .
$ echo info.foo: bar &gt; application.properties
$ git add -A .
$ git commit -m "Add application.properties"</screen>
</tip>
<warning>
<simpara>using the local filesystem for your git repository is
intended for testing only. Use a server to host your
configuration repositories in production.</simpara>
</warning>
<warning>
<simpara>the initial clone of your configuration repository will
be quick and efficient if you only keep text files in it. If you start
to store binary files, especially large ones, you may experience
delays on the first request for configuration and/or out of memory
errors in the server.</simpara>
</warning>
<section xml:id="_environment_repository">
<title>Environment Repository</title>
<simpara>Where do you want to store the configuration data for the Config
Server? The strategy that governs this behaviour is the
<literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal>, serving <literal>Environment</literal> objects. This
<literal>Environment</literal> is a shallow copy of the domain from the Spring
<literal>Environment</literal> (including <literal>propertySources</literal> as the main feature). The
<literal>Environment</literal> resources are parametrized by three variables:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>{application}</literal> maps to "spring.application.name" on the client side;</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>{profile}</literal> maps to "spring.profiles.active" on the client (comma separated list); and</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>{label}</literal> which is a server side feature labelling a "versioned" set of config files.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Repository implementations generally behave just like a Spring Boot
application loading configuration files from a "spring.config.name"
equal to the <literal>{application}</literal> parameter, and "spring.profiles.active"
equal to the <literal>{profiles}</literal> parameter. Precedence rules for profiles are
also the same as in a regular Boot application: active profiles take
precedence over defaults, and if there are multiple profiles the last
one wins (like adding entries to a <literal>Map</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>Example: a client application has this bootstrap configuration:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>bootstrap.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  application:
    name: foo
  profiles:
    active: dev,mysql</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>(as usual with a Spring Boot application, these properties could also
be set as environment variables or command line arguments).</simpara>
<simpara>If the repository is file-based, the server will create an
<literal>Environment</literal> from <literal>application.yml</literal> (shared between all clients), and
<literal>foo.yml</literal> (with <literal>foo.yml</literal> taking precedence). If the YAML files have
documents inside them that point to Spring profiles, those are applied
with higher precedence (in order of the profiles listed), and if
there are profile-specific YAML (or properties) files these are also
applied with higher precedence than the defaults. Higher precedence
translates to a <literal>PropertySource</literal> listed earlier in the
<literal>Environment</literal>. (These are the same rules as apply in a standalone
Spring Boot application.)</simpara>
<section xml:id="_git_backend">
<title>Git Backend</title>
<simpara>The default implementation of <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> uses a Git
backend, which is very convenient for managing upgrades and physical
environments, and also for auditing changes. To change the location of
the repository you can set the "spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri"
configuration property in the Config Server (e.g. in
<literal>application.yml</literal>). If you set it with a <literal>file:</literal> prefix it should work
from a local repository so you can get started quickly and easily
without a server, but in that case the server operates directly on the
local repository without cloning it (it doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s not
bare because the Config Server never makes changes to the "remote"
repository). To scale the Config Server up and make it highly
available, you would need to have all instances of the server pointing
to the same repository, so only a shared file system would work. Even
in that case it is better to use the <literal>ssh:</literal> protocol for a shared
filesystem repository, so that the server can clone it and use a local
working copy as a cache.</simpara>
<simpara>This repository implementation maps the <literal>{label}</literal> parameter of the
HTTP resource to a git label (commit id, branch name or tag). If the
git branch or tag name contains a slash ("/") then the label in the
HTTP URL should be specified with the special string "(_)" instead (to
avoid ambiguity with other URL paths).  For example, if the label is
<literal>foo/bar</literal>, replacing the slash would result in a label that looks like
<literal>foo(_)bar</literal>.  The inclusion of the special string "(_)" can also be
applied to the <literal>{application}</literal> parameter. Be careful with the brackets
in the URL if you are using a command line client like curl (e.g.
escape them from the shell with quotes '').</simpara>
<section xml:id="_placeholders_in_git_uri">
<title>Placeholders in Git URI</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Config Server supports a git repository URL with
placeholders for the <literal>{application}</literal> and <literal>{profile}</literal> (and <literal>{label}</literal> if
you need it, but remember that the label is applied as a git label
anyway). So you can easily support a "one repo per application" policy
using (for example):</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/myorg/{application}</programlisting>
<simpara>or a "one repo per profile" policy using a similar pattern but with
<literal>{profile}</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Additionally, using the special string "(_)" within your
<literal>{application}</literal> parameters can enable support for multiple
organizations (for example):</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/{application}</programlisting>
<simpara>where <literal>{application}</literal> is provided at request time in the format
"organization(_)application".</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_pattern_matching_and_multiple_repositories">
<title>Pattern Matching and Multiple Repositories</title>
<simpara>There is also support for more complex requirements with pattern
matching on the application and profile name. The pattern format is a
comma-separated list of <literal>{application}/{profile}</literal> names with wildcards
(where a pattern beginning with a wildcard may need to be
quoted). Example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          repos:
            simple: https://github.com/simple/config-repo
            special:
              pattern: special*/dev*,*special*/dev*
              uri: https://github.com/special/config-repo
            local:
              pattern: local*
              uri: file:/home/configsvc/config-repo</programlisting>
<simpara>If <literal>{application}/{profile}</literal> does not match any of the patterns, it
will use the default uri defined under
"spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri". In the above example, for the
"simple" repository, the pattern is <literal>simple/*</literal> (i.e. it only matches
one application named "simple" in all profiles). The "local"
repository matches all application names beginning with "local" in all
profiles (the <literal>/*</literal> suffix is added automatically to any pattern that
doesn&#8217;t have a profile matcher).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>the "one-liner" short cut used in the "simple" example above can
only be used if the only property to be set is the URI. If you need to
set anything else (credentials, pattern, etc.) you need to use the full
form.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>The <literal>pattern</literal> property in the repo is actually an array, so you can
use a YAML array (or <literal>[0]</literal>, <literal>[1]</literal>, etc. suffixes in properties files)
to bind to multiple patterns. You may need to do this if you are going
to run apps with multiple profiles. Example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          repos:
            development:
              pattern:
                - '*/development'
                - '*/staging'
              uri: https://github.com/development/config-repo
            staging:
              pattern:
                - '*/qa'
                - '*/production'
              uri: https://github.com/staging/config-repo</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>Spring Cloud will guess that a pattern containing a profile that
doesn&#8217;t end in <literal>*</literal> implies that you actually want to match a list of
profiles starting with this pattern (so <literal>*/staging</literal> is a shortcut for
<literal>["*/staging", "*/staging,*"]</literal>). This is common where you need to run
apps in the "development" profile locally but also the "cloud" profile
remotely, for instance.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Every repository can also optionally store config files in
sub-directories, and patterns to search for those directories can be
specified as <literal>searchPaths</literal>. For example at the top level:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          searchPaths: foo,bar*</programlisting>
<simpara>In this example the server searches for config files in the top level
and in the "foo/" sub-directory and also any sub-directory whose name
begins with "bar".</simpara>
<simpara>By default the server clones remote repositories when configuration
is first requested. The server can be configured to clone the repositories
at startup. For example at the top level:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:

<simpara>In this example the server clones team-a&#8217;s config-repo on startup before it
accepts any requests. All other repositories will not be cloned until
configuration from the repository is requested.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Setting a repository to be cloned when the Config Server starts up can
help to identify a misconfigured configuration source (e.g., an invalid
repository URI) quickly, while the Config Server is starting up. With
<literal>cloneOnStart</literal> not enabled for a configuration source, the Config Server may
start successfully with a misconfigured or invalid configuration source and
not detect an error until an application requests configuration from that
configuration source.</simpara>

<title>Authentication</title>
<simpara>To use HTTP basic authentication on the remote repository add the
"username" and "password" properties separately (not in the URL),
e.g.</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          username: trolley
          password: strongpassword</programlisting>
<simpara>If you don&#8217;t use HTTPS and user credentials, SSH should also work out
of the box when you store keys in the default directories (<literal>~/.ssh</literal>)
and the uri points to an SSH location,
e.g. "<link xl:href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</link>:configuration/cloud-configuration". It is important that an entry for the Git server be present in the <literal>~/.ssh/known_hosts</literal> file and that it is in <literal>ssh-rsa</literal> format. Other formats (like <literal>ecdsa-sha2-nistp256</literal>) are not supported. To avoid surprises, you should ensure that only one entry is present in the <literal>known_hosts</literal> file for the Git server and that it is matching with the URL you provided to the config server. If you used a hostname in the URL, you want to have exactly that in the <literal>known_hosts</literal> file, not the IP.
The repository is accessed using JGit, so any documentation you find on
that should be applicable. HTTPS proxy settings can be set in
<literal>~/.git/config</literal> or in the same way as for any other JVM process via
system properties (<literal>-Dhttps.proxyHost</literal> and <literal>-Dhttps.proxyPort</literal>).</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>If you don&#8217;t know where your <literal>~/.git</literal> directory is use <literal>git config
--global</literal> to manipulate the settings (e.g. <literal>git config --global
http.sslVerify false</literal>).</simpara>

<title>Authentication with AWS CodeCommit</title>
<simpara><link xl:href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/welcome.html">AWS CodeCommit</link> authentication can also be
done. AWS CodeCommit uses an authentication helper when using Git from the command line. This helper is not
used with the JGit library, so a JGit CredentialProvider for AWS CodeCommit will be created if the Git
URI matches the AWS CodeCommit pattern. AWS CodeCommit URIs always look like
<link xl:href="https://git-codecommit.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/${repopath}">https://git-codecommit.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/${repopath}</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>If you provide a username and password with an AWS CodeCommit URI, then these must be
the <link xl:href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSGettingStartedGuide/AWSCredentials.html">AWS accessKeyId and secretAccessKey</link>
to be used to access the repository. If you do not specify a username and password,
then the accessKeyId and secretAccessKey will be retrieved using the
<link xl:href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html">AWS Default Credential Provider Chain</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>If your Git URI matches the CodeCommit URI pattern (above) then you must provide
valid AWS credentials in the username and password, or in one of the locations supported
by the default credential provider chain. AWS EC2 instances may use
<link xl:href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html">IAM Roles for EC2 Instances</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>Note: The aws-java-sdk-core jar is an optional dependency. If the aws-java-sdk-core jar is not on your
classpath, then the AWS Code Commit credential provider will not be created regardless of the git server URI.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_git_ssh_configuration_using_properties">
<title>Git SSH configuration using properties</title>
<simpara>By default, the JGit library used by Spring Cloud Config Server uses SSH configuration files such as <literal>~/.ssh/known_hosts</literal> and <literal>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</literal> when connecting to Git repositories using an SSH URI.
In cloud environments such as Cloud Foundry, the local filesystem may be ephemeral or not easily accessible. For cases such as these, SSH configuration can be set using
Java properties. In order to activate property based SSH configuration, the property <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.git.ignoreLocalSshSettings</literal> must be set to <literal>true</literal>.

<title>Placeholders in Git Search Paths</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Config Server also supports a search path with
placeholders for the <literal>{application}</literal> and <literal>{profile}</literal> (and <literal>{label}</literal> if
you need it). Example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:

        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo

<simpara>searches the repository for files in the same name as the directory
(as well as the top level). Wildcards are also valid in a search
path with placeholders (any matching directory is included in the
search).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_force_pull_in_git_repositories">
<title>Force pull in Git Repositories</title>
<simpara>As mentioned before Spring Cloud Config Server makes a clone of the
remote git repository and if somehow the local copy gets dirty (e.g.
folder content changes by OS process) so Spring Cloud Config Server
cannot update the local copy from remote repository.</simpara>
<simpara>To solve this there is a <literal>force-pull</literal> property that will make Spring Cloud
Config Server force pull from remote repository if the local copy is dirty.
Example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          force-pull: true</programlisting>
<simpara>If you have a multiple repositories configuration you can configure the
<literal>force-pull</literal> property per repository. Example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://git/common/config-repo.git

<section xml:id="_version_control_backend_filesystem_use">
<title>Version Control Backend Filesystem Use</title>
<warning>
<simpara>With VCS based backends (git, svn) files are checked out or cloned to the local filesystem. By default they are put in the system temporary directory with a prefix of <literal>config-repo-</literal>. On linux, for example it could be <literal>/tmp/config-repo-&lt;randomid&gt;</literal>. Some operating systems <link xl:href="http://serverfault.com/questions/377348/when-does-tmp-get-cleared/377349#377349">routinely clean out</link> temporary directories. This can lead to unexpected behaviour such as missing properties. To avoid this problem, change the directory Config Server uses, by setting <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.git.basedir</literal> or <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.svn.basedir</literal> to a directory that does not reside in the system temp structure.</simpara>
</warning>
</section>
<section xml:id="_file_system_backend">
<title>File System Backend</title>
<simpara>There is also a "native" profile in the Config Server that doesn&#8217;t use
Git, but just loads the config files from the local classpath or file
system (any static URL you want to point to with
"spring.cloud.config.server.native.searchLocations"). To use the
native profile just launch the Config Server with
"spring.profiles.active=native".</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Remember to use the <literal>file:</literal> prefix for file resources (the
default without a prefix is usually the classpath). Just as with any
Spring Boot configuration you can embed <literal>${}</literal>-style environment
placeholders, but remember that absolute paths in Windows require an
extra "/", e.g. <literal><link xl:href="file:///${user.home}/config-repo">file:///${user.home}/config-repo</link></literal></simpara>
</note>
<warning>
<simpara>The default value of the <literal>searchLocations</literal> is identical to a
local Spring Boot application (so <literal>[classpath:/, classpath:/config,
file:./, file:./config]</literal>). This does not expose the
<literal>application.properties</literal> from the server to all clients because any
property sources present in the server are removed before being sent
to the client.</simpara>
</warning>
<tip>
<simpara>A filesystem backend is great for getting started quickly and
for testing. To use it in production you need to be sure that the
file system is reliable, and shared across all instances of the
Config Server.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>The search locations can contain placeholders for <literal>{application}</literal>,
<literal>{profile}</literal> and <literal>{label}</literal>. In this way you can segregate the
directories in the path, and choose a strategy that makes sense for
you (e.g. sub-directory per application, or sub-directory per
profile).</simpara>
<simpara>If you don&#8217;t use placeholders in the search locations, this repository
also appends the <literal>{label}</literal> parameter of the HTTP resource to a suffix
on the search path, so properties files are loaded from each search
location <emphasis role="strong">and</emphasis> a subdirectory with the same name as the label (the
labelled properties take precedence in the Spring Environment). Thus
the default behaviour with no placeholders is the same as adding a
search location ending with <literal>/{label}/</literal>. For example <literal>file:/tmp/config</literal>
is the same as <literal>file:/tmp/config,file:/tmp/config/{label}</literal>. This behavior can be
disabled by setting <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.native.addLabelLocations=false</literal>.</simpara>

<simpara>Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets. A secret is anything
that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords,
certificates, and more. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret,
while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.</simpara>
</sidebar>
<simpara>For more information on Vault see the <link xl:href="https://www.vaultproject.io/intro/index.html">Vault quickstart guide</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>To enable the config server to use a Vault backend you can run your config server
with the <literal>vault</literal> profile.  For example in your config server&#8217;s <literal>application.properties</literal>
you can add <literal>spring.profiles.active=vault</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>By default the config server will assume your Vault server is running at
<literal><link xl:href="http://127.0.0.1:8200">http://127.0.0.1:8200</link></literal>.  It also will assume that the name of backend
is <literal>secret</literal> and the key is <literal>application</literal>.  All of these defaults can be
configured in your config server&#8217;s <literal>application.properties</literal>.  Below is a

<section xml:id="_file_based_repositories">
<title>File Based Repositories</title>
<simpara>With file-based (i.e. git, svn and native) repositories, resources
with file names in <literal>application*</literal> are shared between all client
applications (so <literal>application.properties</literal>, <literal>application.yml</literal>,
<literal>application-*.properties</literal> etc.). You can use resources with these
file names to configure global defaults and have them overridden by
application-specific files as necessary.</simpara>
<simpara>The #_property_overrides[property overrides] feature can also be used
for setting global defaults, and with placeholders applications are
allowed to override them locally.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>With the "native" profile (local file system backend) it is
recommended that you use an explicit search location that isn&#8217;t part
of the server&#8217;s own configuration. Otherwise the <literal>application*</literal>
resources in the default search locations are removed because they are
part of the server.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_vault_server">
<title>Vault Server</title>
<simpara>When using Vault as a backend you can share configuration with
all applications by placing configuration in

<programlisting language="sh" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ vault write secret/application foo=bar baz=bam</programlisting>
<simpara>All applications using the config server will have the properties
<literal>foo</literal> and <literal>baz</literal> available to them.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_jdbc_backend">
<title>JDBC Backend</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Config Server supports JDBC (relation database) as a
backend for configuration properties. You can enable this feature by
adding <literal>spring-jdbc</literal> to the classpath, and using the "jdbc" profile,
or by adding a bean of type <literal>JdbcEnvironmentRepository</literal>. Spring Boot
will configure a data source if you include the right dependencies on
the classpath (see the user guide for more details on that).</simpara>
<simpara>The database needs to have a table called "PROPERTIES" with columns
"APPLICATION", "PROFILE", "LABEL" (with the usual <literal>Environment</literal>
meaning), plus "KEY" and "VALUE" for the key and value pairs in
<literal>Properties</literal> style. All fields are of type String in Java, so you can
make them <literal>VARCHAR</literal> of whatever length you need. Property values
behave in the same way as they would if they came from Spring Boot
properties files named <literal>{application}-{profile}.properties</literal>, including
all the encryption and decryption, which will be applied as
post-processing steps (i.e. not in the repository implementation
directly).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_composite_environment_repositories">
<title>Composite Environment Repositories</title>
<simpara>In some scenarios you may wish to pull configuration data from multiple
environment repositories.  To do this you can just enable
multiple profiles in your config server&#8217;s application properties or YAML file.
If, for example, you want to pull configuration data from a Git repository
as well as a SVN repository you would set the following properties for your
configuration server.</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  profiles:
    active: git, svn
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        svn:
          uri: file:///path/to/svn/repo
          order: 2
        git:
          uri: file:///path/to/git/repo
          order: 1</programlisting>
<simpara>In addition to each repo specifying a URI, you can also specify an <literal>order</literal> property.
The <literal>order</literal> property allows you to specify the priority order for all your repositories.
The lower the numerical value of the <literal>order</literal> property the higher priority it will have.
The priority order of a repository will help resolve any potential conflicts between
repositories that contain values for the same properties.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Any type of failure when retrieving values from an environment repositoy
will result in a failure for the entire composite environment.</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>When using a composite environment it is important that all repos contain
the same label(s).  If you have an environment similar to the one above and you request
configuration data with the label <literal>master</literal> but the SVN
repo does not contain a branch called <literal>master</literal> the entire request will fail.</simpara>
</note>
<section xml:id="_custom_composite_environment_repositories">
<title>Custom Composite Environment Repositories</title>
<simpara>It is also possible to provide your own <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> bean
to be included as part of a composite environment in addition to
using one of the environment repositories from Spring Cloud.  To do this your bean
must implement the <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> interface.  If you would like to control
the priority of you custom <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> within the composite
environment you should also implement the <literal>Ordered</literal> interface and override the
<literal>getOrdered</literal> method.  If you do not implement the <literal>Ordered</literal> interface then your
<literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> will be given the lowest priority.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="_property_overrides">
<title>Property Overrides</title>
<simpara>The Config Server has an "overrides" feature that allows the operator
to provide configuration properties to all applications that cannot be
accidentally changed by the application using the normal Spring Boot
hooks. To declare overrides just add a map of name-value pairs to
<literal>spring.cloud.config.server.overrides</literal>. For example</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        overrides:
          foo: bar</programlisting>
<simpara>will cause all applications that are config clients to read <literal>foo=bar</literal>
independent of their own configuration. (Of course an application can
use the data in the Config Server in any way it likes, so overrides
are not enforceable, but they do provide useful default behaviour if
they are Spring Cloud Config clients.)</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>Normal, Spring environment placeholders with "${}" can be escaped
(and resolved on the client) by using backslash ("\") to escape the
"$" or the "{", e.g. <literal>\${app.foo:bar}</literal> resolves to "bar" unless the
app provides its own "app.foo". Note that in YAML you don&#8217;t need to
escape the backslash itself, but in properties files you do, when you
configure the overrides on the server.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>You can change the priority of all overrides in the client to be more
like default values, allowing applications to supply their own values
in environment variables or System properties, by setting the flag
<literal>spring.cloud.config.overrideNone=true</literal> (default is false) in the
remote repository.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="_health_indicator_2">
<title>Health Indicator</title>
<simpara>Config Server comes with a Health Indicator that checks if the configured
<literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> is working.  By default it asks the <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal>
for an application named <literal>app</literal>, the <literal>default</literal> profile and the default
label provided by the <literal>EnvironmentRepository</literal> implementation.</simpara>
<simpara>You can configure the Health Indicator to check more applications
along with custom profiles and custom labels, e.g.</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        health:
          repositories:
            myservice:
              label: mylabel
            myservice-dev:
              name: myservice
              profiles: development</programlisting>
<simpara>You can disable the Health Indicator by setting <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.health.enabled=false</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_security">
<title>Security</title>
<simpara>You are free to secure your Config Server in any way that makes sense
to you (from physical network security to OAuth2 bearer
tokens), and Spring Security and Spring Boot make it easy to do pretty
much anything.</simpara>
<simpara>To use the default Spring Boot configured HTTP Basic security, just
include Spring Security on the classpath (e.g. through
<literal>spring-boot-starter-security</literal>). The default is a username of "user"
and a randomly generated password, which isn&#8217;t going to be very useful
in practice, so we recommend you configure the password (via
<literal>security.user.password</literal>) and encrypt it (see below for instructions
on how to do that).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_encryption_and_decryption_2">
<title>Encryption and Decryption</title>
<important>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Prerequisites:</emphasis> to use the encryption and decryption features
you need the full-strength JCE installed in your JVM (it&#8217;s not there by default).
You can download the "Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files"
from Oracle, and follow instructions for installation (essentially replace the 2 policy files
in the JRE lib/security directory with the ones that you downloaded).</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>If the remote property sources contain encrypted content (values
starting with <literal>{cipher}</literal>) they will be decrypted before sending to
clients over HTTP. The main advantage of this set up is that the
property values don&#8217;t have to be in plain text when they are "at rest"
(e.g. in a git repository). If a value cannot be decrypted it is
removed from the property source and an additional property is added
with the same key, but prefixed with "invalid." and a value that means
"not applicable" (usually "&lt;n/a&gt;"). This is largely to prevent cipher
text being used as a password and accidentally leaking.</simpara>
<simpara>If you are setting up a remote config repository for config client
applications it might contain an <literal>application.yml</literal> like this, for
instance:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:
  datasource:
    username: dbuser
    password: '{cipher}FKSAJDFGYOS8F7GLHAKERGFHLSAJ'</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Encrypted values in a .properties file must not be wrapped in quotes, otherwise the value will not be decrypted:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.properties</title>
<para>
<screen>spring.datasource.username: dbuser
spring.datasource.password: {cipher}FKSAJDFGYOS8F7GLHAKERGFHLSAJ</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>You can safely push this plain text to a shared git repository and the
secret password is protected.</simpara>
<simpara>The server also exposes <literal>/encrypt</literal> and <literal>/decrypt</literal> endpoints (on the
assumption that these will be secured and only accessed by authorized
agents). If you are editing a remote config file you can use the Config Server
to encrypt values by POSTing to the <literal>/encrypt</literal> endpoint, e.g.</simpara>
<screen>$ curl localhost:8888/encrypt -d mysecret
682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda</screen>
<note>
<simpara>If the value you are encrypting has characters in it that need to be URL encoded you should use
the <literal>--data-urlencode</literal> option to <literal>curl</literal> to make sure they are encoded properly.</simpara>
</note>
<tip>
<simpara>Be sure not to include any of the curl command statistics in the encrypted value.
Outputting the value to a file can help avoid this problem.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>The inverse operation is also available via <literal>/decrypt</literal> (provided the server is
configured with a symmetric key or a full key pair):</simpara>
<screen>$ curl localhost:8888/decrypt -d 682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda
mysecret</screen>
<tip>
<simpara>If you are testing like this with curl, then use
<literal>--data-urlencode</literal> (instead of <literal>-d</literal>) or set an explicit <literal>Content-Type:
text/plain</literal> to make sure curl encodes the data correctly when there
are special characters ('+' is particularly tricky).</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>Take the encrypted value and add the <literal>{cipher}</literal> prefix before you put
it in the YAML or properties file, and before you commit and push it
to a remote, potentially insecure store.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>/encrypt</literal> and <literal>/decrypt</literal> endpoints also both accept paths of the
form <literal>/*/{name}/{profiles}</literal> which can be used to control cryptography
per application (name) and profile when clients call into the main
Environment resource.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>to control the cryptography in this granular way you must also
provide a <literal>@Bean</literal> of type <literal>TextEncryptorLocator</literal> that creates a
different encryptor per name and profiles. The one that is provided
by default does not do this (so all encryptions use the same key).</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>The <literal>spring</literal> command line client (with Spring Cloud CLI extensions
installed) can also be used to encrypt and decrypt, e.g.</simpara>
<screen>$ spring encrypt mysecret --key foo
682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda
$ spring decrypt --key foo 682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda
mysecret</screen>
<simpara>To use a key in a file (e.g. an RSA public key for encryption) prepend
the key value with "@" and provide the file path, e.g.</simpara>
<screen>$ spring encrypt mysecret --key @${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
AQAjPgt3eFZQXwt8tsHAVv/QHiY5sI2dRcR+...</screen>
<simpara>The key argument is mandatory (despite having a <literal>--</literal> prefix).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_key_management">
<title>Key Management</title>
<simpara>The Config Server can use a symmetric (shared) key or an asymmetric
one (RSA key pair). The asymmetric choice is superior in terms of
security, but it is often more convenient to use a symmetric key since
it is just a single property value to configure in the <literal>bootstrap.properties</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To configure a symmetric key you just need to set <literal>encrypt.key</literal> to a
secret String (or use an enviroment variable <literal>ENCRYPT_KEY</literal> to keep it
out of plain text configuration files).</simpara>
<simpara>To configure an asymmetric key you can either set the key as a
PEM-encoded text value (in <literal>encrypt.key</literal>), or via a keystore (e.g. as
created by the <literal>keytool</literal> utility that comes with the JDK). The
keystore properties are <literal>encrypt.keyStore.*</literal> with <literal>*</literal> equal to</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>location</literal> (a <literal>Resource</literal> location),</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>password</literal> (to unlock the keystore) and</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>alias</literal> (to identify which key in the store is to be
used).</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The encryption is done with the public key, and a private key is
needed for decryption. Thus in principle you can configure only the
public key in the server if you only want to do encryption (and are
prepared to decrypt the values yourself locally with the private
key). In practice you might not want to do that because it spreads the
key management process around all the clients, instead of
concentrating it in the server. On the other hand it&#8217;s a useful option
if your config server really is relatively insecure and only a
handful of clients need the encrypted properties.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_creating_a_key_store_for_testing">
<title>Creating a Key Store for Testing</title>
<simpara>To create a keystore for testing you can do something like this:</simpara>

  -dname "CN=Web Server,OU=Unit,O=Organization,L=City,S=State,C=US" \
  -keypass changeme -keystore server.jks -storepass letmein</screen>
<simpara>Put the <literal>server.jks</literal> file in the classpath (for instance) and then in

<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">encrypt:
  keyStore:
    location: classpath:/server.jks
    password: letmein
    alias: mytestkey
    secret: changeme</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_using_multiple_keys_and_key_rotation">
<title>Using Multiple Keys and Key Rotation</title>
<simpara>In addition to the <literal>{cipher}</literal> prefix in encrypted property values, the
Config Server looks for <literal>{name:value}</literal> prefixes (zero or many) before
the start of the (Base64 encoded) cipher text. The keys are passed to
a <literal>TextEncryptorLocator</literal> which can do whatever logic it needs to
locate a <literal>TextEncryptor</literal> for the cipher. If you have configured a
keystore (<literal>encrypt.keystore.location</literal>) the default locator will look
for keys in the store with aliases as supplied by the "key" prefix,
i.e. with a cipher text like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">foo:
  bar: `{cipher}{key:testkey}...`</programlisting>
<simpara>the locator will look for a key named "testkey". A secret can also be
supplied via a <literal>{secret:&#8230;&#8203;}</literal> value in the prefix, but if it is not
the default is to use the keystore password (which is what you get
when you build a keytore and don&#8217;t specify a secret). If you <emphasis role="strong">do</emphasis>
supply a secret it is recommended that you also encrypt the secrets
using a custom <literal>SecretLocator</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Key rotation is hardly ever necessary on cryptographic grounds if the
keys are only being used to encrypt a few bytes of configuration data
(i.e. they are not being used elsewhere), but occasionally you might
need to change the keys if there is a security breach for instance. In
that case all the clients would need to change their source config
files (e.g. in git) and use a new <literal>{key:&#8230;&#8203;}</literal> prefix in all the
ciphers, checking beforehand of course that the key alias is available
in the Config Server keystore.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>the <literal>{name:value}</literal> prefixes can also be added to plaintext posted
to the <literal>/encrypt</literal> endpoint, if you want to let the Config Server
handle all encryption as well as decryption.</simpara>
</tip>
</section>
<section xml:id="_serving_encrypted_properties">
<title>Serving Encrypted Properties</title>
<simpara>Sometimes you want the clients to decrypt the configuration locally,
instead of doing it in the server. In that case you can still have
/encrypt and /decrypt endpoints (if you provide the <literal>encrypt.*</literal>
configuration to locate a key), but you need to explicitly switch off
the decryption of outgoing properties using
<literal>spring.cloud.config.server.encrypt.enabled=false</literal>. If you don&#8217;t care
about the endpoints, then it should work if you configure neither the
key nor the enabled flag.</simpara>
</section>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_serving_alternative_formats">
<title>Serving Alternative Formats</title>
<simpara>The default JSON format from the environment endpoints is perfect for
consumption by Spring applications because it maps directly onto the
<literal>Environment</literal> abstraction. If you prefer you can consume the same data
as YAML or Java properties by adding a suffix to the resource path
(".yml", ".yaml" or ".properties"). This can be useful for consumption
by applications that do not care about the structure of the JSON
endpoints, or the extra metadata they provide, for example an
application that is not using Spring might benefit from the simplicity
of this approach.</simpara>
<simpara>The YAML and properties representations have an additional flag
(provided as a boolean query parameter <literal>resolvePlaceholders</literal>) to
signal that placeholders in the source documents, in the standard
Spring <literal>${&#8230;&#8203;}</literal> form, should be resolved in the output where possible
before rendering. This is a useful feature for consumers that don&#8217;t
know about the Spring placeholder conventions.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>there are limitations in using the YAML or properties formats,
mainly in relation to the loss of metadata. The JSON is structured as
an ordered list of property sources, for example, with names that
correlate with the source. The YAML and properties forms are coalesced
into a single map, even if the origin of the values has multiple
sources, and the names of the original source files are lost. The YAML
representation is not necessarily a faithful representation of the
YAML source in a backing repository either: it is constructed from a
list of flat property sources, and assumptions have to be made about
the form of the keys.</simpara>
</note>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_serving_plain_text">
<title>Serving Plain Text</title>
<simpara>Instead of using the <literal>Environment</literal> abstraction (or one of the
alternative representations of it in YAML or properties format) your
applications might need generic plain text configuration files,
tailored to their environment. The Config Server provides these
through an additional endpoint at <literal>/{name}/{profile}/{label}/{path}</literal>
where "name", "profile" and "label" have the same meaning as the
regular environment endpoint, but "path" is a file name
(e.g. <literal>log.xml</literal>). The source files for this endpoint are located in
the same way as for the environment endpoints: the same search path is
used as for properties or YAML files, but instead of aggregating all
matching resources, only the first one to match is returned.</simpara>
<simpara>After a resource is located, placeholders in the normal format
(<literal>${&#8230;&#8203;}</literal>) are resolved using the effective <literal>Environment</literal> for the
application name, profile and label supplied. In this way the resource
endpoint is tightly integrated with the environment
endpoints. Example, if you have this layout for a GIT (or SVN)
repository:</simpara>
<screen>application.yml
nginx.conf</screen>
<simpara>where <literal>nginx.conf</literal> looks like this:</simpara>
<screen>server {
    listen              80;
    server_name         ${nginx.server.name};
}</screen>
<simpara>and <literal>application.yml</literal> like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">nginx:
  server:
    name: example.com
---
spring:
  profiles: development
nginx:
  server:
    name: develop.com</programlisting>
<simpara>then the <literal>/foo/default/master/nginx.conf</literal> resource looks like this:</simpara>
<screen>server {
    listen              80;
    server_name         example.com;
}</screen>
<simpara>and <literal>/foo/development/master/nginx.conf</literal> like this:</simpara>
<screen>server {
    listen              80;
    server_name         develop.com;
}</screen>
<note>
<simpara>Just like the source files for environment configuration, the
"profile" is used to resolve the file name, so if you want a
profile-specific file then <literal>/*/development/*/logback.xml</literal> will be
resolved by a file called <literal>logback-development.xml</literal> (in preference
to <literal>logback.xml</literal>).</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>If you do not want to supply the <literal>label</literal> and let the server use the default label, you can supply a <literal>useDefaultLabel</literal> request parameter. So, the above example for the <literal>default</literal> profile could look like <literal>/foo/default/nginx.conf?useDefaultLabel</literal>.</simpara>

</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_embedding_the_config_server">
<title>Embedding the Config Server</title>
<simpara>The Config Server runs best as a standalone application, but if you
need to you can embed it in another application. Just use the
<literal>@EnableConfigServer</literal> annotation. An optional property that can be
useful in this case is <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.bootstrap</literal> which is
a flag to indicate that the server should configure itself from its
own remote repository. The flag is off by default because it can delay
startup, but when embedded in another application it makes sense to
initialize the same way as any other application.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>It should be obvious, but remember that if you use the bootstrap
flag the config server will need to have its name and repository URI
configured in <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>To change the location of the server endpoints you can (optionally)
set <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.prefix</literal>, e.g. "/config", to serve the
resources under a prefix. The prefix should start but not end with a
"/". It is applied to the <literal>@RequestMappings</literal> in the Config Server
(i.e. underneath the Spring Boot prefixes <literal>server.servletPath</literal> and
<literal>server.contextPath</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>If you want to read the configuration for an application directly from
the backend repository (instead of from the config server) that&#8217;s
basically an embedded config server with no endpoints. You can switch
off the endpoints entirely if you don&#8217;t use the <literal>@EnableConfigServer</literal>
annotation (just set <literal>spring.cloud.config.server.bootstrap=true</literal>).</simpara>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_push_notifications_and_spring_cloud_bus">
<title>Push Notifications and Spring Cloud Bus</title>
<simpara>Many source code repository providers (like Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket
for instance) will notify you of changes in a repository through a
webhook. You can configure the webhook via the provider&#8217;s user
interface as a URL and a set of events in which you are
interested. For instance
<link xl:href="https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pushevent">Github</link>
will POST to the webhook with a JSON body containing a list of
commits, and a header "X-Github-Event" equal to "push". If you add a
dependency on the <literal>spring-cloud-config-monitor</literal> library and activate
the Spring Cloud Bus in your Config Server, then a "/monitor" endpoint
is enabled.</simpara>
<simpara>When the webhook is activated the Config Server will send a
<literal>RefreshRemoteApplicationEvent</literal> targeted at the applications it thinks
might have changed. The change detection can be strategized, but by
default it just looks for changes in files that match the application
name (e.g. "foo.properties" is targeted at the "foo" application, and
"application.properties" is targeted at all applications). The strategy
if you want to override the behaviour is <literal>PropertyPathNotificationExtractor</literal>
which accepts the request headers and body as parameters and returns a list
of file paths that changed.</simpara>
<simpara>The default configuration works out of the box with Github, Gitlab or
Bitbucket. In addition to the JSON notifications from Github, Gitlab
or Bitbucket you can trigger a change notification by POSTing to
"/monitor" with a form-encoded body parameters <literal>path={name}</literal>. This will
broadcast to applications matching the "{name}" pattern (can contain
wildcards).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>the <literal>RefreshRemoteApplicationEvent</literal> will only be transmitted if
the <literal>spring-cloud-bus</literal> is activated in the Config Server and in the
client application.</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>the default configuration also detects filesystem changes in
local git repositories (the webhook is not used in that case but as
soon as you edit a config file a refresh will be broadcast).</simpara>

<simpara>This is the default behaviour for any application which has the Spring
Cloud Config Client on the classpath. When a config client starts up
it binds to the Config Server (via the bootstrap configuration
property <literal>spring.cloud.config.uri</literal>) and initializes Spring
<literal>Environment</literal> with remote property sources.</simpara>
<simpara>The net result of this is that all client apps that want to consume
the Config Server need a <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal> (or an environment variable)
with the server address in <literal>spring.cloud.config.uri</literal> (defaults to
"http://localhost:8888").</simpara>

<title>Discovery First Bootstrap</title>
<simpara>If you are using a `DiscoveryClient implementation, such as Spring Cloud Netflix
and Eureka Service Discovery or Spring Cloud Consul (Spring Cloud Zookeeper does
not support this yet), then you can have the Config Server register with the
Discovery Service if you want to, but in the default "Config First" mode,
clients won&#8217;t be able to take advantage of the registration.</simpara>
<simpara>If you prefer to use <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> to locate the Config Server, you can do
that by setting <literal>spring.cloud.config.discovery.enabled=true</literal> (default
"false"). The net result of that is that client apps all need a
<literal>bootstrap.yml</literal> (or an environment variable) with the appropriate discovery
configuration. For example, with Spring Cloud Netflix, you need to define the
Eureka server address, e.g. in <literal>eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone</literal>.  The
price for using this option is an extra network round trip on start up to
locate the service registration. The benefit is that the Config Server
can change its co-ordinates, as long as the Discovery Service is a fixed point. The
default service id is "configserver" but you can change that on the
client with <literal>spring.cloud.config.discovery.serviceId</literal> (and on the server
in the usual way for a service, e.g. by setting <literal>spring.application.name</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>The discovery client implementations all support some kind of metadata
map (e.g. for Eureka we have <literal>eureka.instance.metadataMap</literal>). Some
additional properties of the Config Server may need to be configured
in its service registration metadata so that clients can connect
correctly. If the Config Server is secured with HTTP Basic you can
configure the credentials as "username" and "password". And if the
Config Server has a context path you can set "configPath". Example,
for a Config Server that is a Eureka client:</simpara>

<title>Config Client Retry</title>
<simpara>If you expect that the config server may occasionally be unavailable when

to set <literal>spring.cloud.config.failFast=true</literal>, and then you need to add
<literal>spring-retry</literal> and <literal>spring-boot-starter-aop</literal> to your classpath. The default
behaviour is to retry 6 times with an initial backoff interval of 1000ms and an
exponential multiplier of 1.1 for subsequent backoffs. You can configure these
properties (and others) using <literal>spring.cloud.config.retry.*</literal> configuration properties.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>To take full control of the retry add a <literal>@Bean</literal> of type

<title>Service Discovery: Eureka Clients</title>
<simpara>Service Discovery is one of the key tenets of a microservice based architecture. Trying to hand configure each client or some form of convention can be very difficult to do and can be very brittle.  Eureka is the Netflix Service Discovery Server and Client.  The server can be configured and deployed to be highly available, with each server replicating state about the registered services to the others.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_registering_with_eureka">
<title>Registering with Eureka</title>
<simpara>When a client registers with Eureka, it provides meta-data about itself
such as host and port, health indicator URL, home page etc.  Eureka
receives heartbeat messages from each instance belonging to a service.
If the heartbeat fails over a configurable timetable, the instance is
normally removed from the registry.</simpara>
<simpara>Example eureka client:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Configuration
@ComponentScan
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@RestController
public class Application {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home() {
        return "Hello world";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new SpringApplicationBuilder(Application.class).web(true).run(args);
    }

}</programlisting>
<simpara>(i.e. utterly normal Spring Boot app). By having <literal>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</literal>
 on the classpath your application will automatically register with the Eureka Server.  Configuration is required to
locate the Eureka server. Example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>eureka:
  client:
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>where "defaultZone" is a magic string fallback value that provides the
service URL for any client that doesn&#8217;t express a preference
(i.e. it&#8217;s a useful default).</simpara>
<simpara>The default application name (service ID), virtual host and non-secure
port, taken from the <literal>Environment</literal>, are <literal>${spring.application.name}</literal>,
<literal>${spring.application.name}</literal> and <literal>${server.port}</literal> respectively.</simpara>
<simpara>Having <literal>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</literal> on the classpath
makes the app into both a Eureka "instance"
(i.e. it registers itself) and a "client" (i.e. it can query the
registry to locate other services). The instance behaviour is driven
by <literal>eureka.instance.*</literal> configuration keys, but the defaults will be
fine if you ensure that your application has a
<literal>spring.application.name</literal> (this is the default for the Eureka service
ID, or VIP).</simpara>
<simpara>See <link xl:href="http://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/tree/master/spring-cloud-netflix-eureka-client/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/netflix/eureka/EurekaInstanceConfigBean.java">EurekaInstanceConfigBean</link> and <link xl:href="http://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/tree/master/spring-cloud-netflix-eureka-client/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/netflix/eureka/EurekaClientConfigBean.java">EurekaClientConfigBean</link> for more details of the configurable options.</simpara>

<title>Authenticating with the Eureka Server</title>
<simpara>HTTP basic authentication will be automatically added to your eureka

credentials embedded in it (curl style, like
<literal><link xl:href="http://user:password@localhost:8761/eureka">http://user:password@localhost:8761/eureka</link></literal>). For more complex needs
you can create a <literal>@Bean</literal> of type <literal>DiscoveryClientOptionalArgs</literal> and

<section xml:id="_status_page_and_health_indicator">
<title>Status Page and Health Indicator</title>
<simpara>The status page and health indicators for a Eureka instance default to
"/info" and "/health" respectively, which are the default locations of
useful endpoints in a Spring Boot Actuator application. You need to
change these, even for an Actuator application if you use a
non-default context path or servlet path
(e.g. <literal>server.servletPath=/foo</literal>) or management endpoint path
(e.g. <literal>management.contextPath=/admin</literal>). Example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>eureka:
  instance:
    statusPageUrlPath: ${management.context-path}/info
    healthCheckUrlPath: ${management.context-path}/health</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>These links show up in the metadata that is consumed by clients, and
used in some scenarios to decide whether to send requests to your
application, so it&#8217;s helpful if they are accurate.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_registering_a_secure_application">
<title>Registering a Secure Application</title>
<simpara>If your app wants to be contacted over HTTPS you can set two flags in
the <literal>EurekaInstanceConfig</literal>, <emphasis>viz</emphasis>
<literal>eureka.instance.[nonSecurePortEnabled,securePortEnabled]=[false,true]</literal>
respectively. This will make Eureka publish instance information
showing an explicit preference for secure communication. The Spring
Cloud <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> will always return a URI starting with <literal>https</literal> for a
service configured this way, and the Eureka (native) instance
information will have a secure health check URL.</simpara>
<simpara>Because of the way
Eureka works internally, it will still publish a non-secure URL for
status and home page unless you also override those explicitly.
You can use placeholders to configure the eureka instance urls,
e.g.</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>eureka:
  instance:
    statusPageUrl: https://${eureka.hostname}/info
    healthCheckUrl: https://${eureka.hostname}/health
    homePageUrl: https://${eureka.hostname}/</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>(Note that <literal>${eureka.hostname}</literal> is a native placeholder only available
in later versions of Eureka. You could achieve the same thing with
Spring placeholders as well, e.g. using <literal>${eureka.instance.hostName}</literal>.)</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>If your app is running behind a proxy, and the SSL termination
is in the proxy (e.g. if you run in Cloud Foundry or other platforms
as a service) then you will need to ensure that the proxy "forwarded"
headers are intercepted and handled by the application. An embedded
Tomcat container in a Spring Boot app does this automatically if it
has explicit configuration for the 'X-Forwarded-\*` headers. A sign
that you got this wrong will be that the links rendered by your app to
itself will be wrong (the wrong host, port or protocol).</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_eureka_s_health_checks">
<title>Eureka&#8217;s Health Checks</title>
<simpara>By default, Eureka uses the client heartbeat to determine if a client is up.
Unless specified otherwise the Discovery Client will not propagate the
current health check status of the application per the Spring Boot Actuator.  Which means
that after successful registration Eureka will always announce that the
application is in 'UP' state. This behaviour can be altered by enabling
Eureka health checks, which results in propagating application status
to Eureka. As a consequence every other application won&#8217;t be sending
traffic to application in state other then 'UP'.</simpara>

<title>Eureka Metadata for Instances and Clients</title>
<simpara>It&#8217;s worth spending a bit of time understanding how the Eureka metadata works, so you can use it in a way that makes sense in your platform. There is standard metadata for things like hostname, IP address, port numbers, status page and health check. These are published in the service registry and used by clients to contact the services in a straightforward way. Additional metadata can be added to the instance registration in the <literal>eureka.instance.metadataMap</literal>, and this will be accessible in the remote clients, but in general will not change the behaviour of the client, unless it is made aware of the meaning of the metadata. There are a couple of special cases described below where Spring Cloud already assigns meaning to the metadata map.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_using_eureka_on_cloudfoundry">
<title>Using Eureka on Cloudfoundry</title>
<simpara>Cloudfoundry has a global router so that all instances of the same app have the same hostname (it&#8217;s the same in other PaaS solutions with a similar architecture). This isn&#8217;t necessarily a barrier to using Eureka, but if you use the router (recommended, or even mandatory depending on the way your platform was set up), you need to explicitly set the hostname and port numbers (secure or non-secure) so that they use the router. You might also want to use instance metadata so you can distinguish between the instances on the client (e.g. in a custom load balancer). By default, the <literal>eureka.instance.instanceId</literal> is <literal>vcap.application.instance_id</literal>. For example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>eureka:

    hostname: ${vcap.application.uris[0]}
    nonSecurePort: 80</screen>

<section xml:id="_changing_the_eureka_instance_id">
<title>Changing the Eureka Instance ID</title>
<simpara>A vanilla Netflix Eureka instance is registered with an ID that is equal to its host name (i.e. only one service per host). Spring Cloud Eureka provides a sensible default that looks like this: <literal>${spring.cloud.client.hostname}:${spring.application.name}:${spring.application.instance_id:${server.port}}}</literal>. For example <literal>myhost:myappname:8080</literal>.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_why_is_it_so_slow_to_register_a_service">
<title>Why is it so Slow to Register a Service?</title>
<simpara>Being an instance also involves a periodic heartbeat to the registry
(via the client&#8217;s <literal>serviceUrl</literal>) with default duration 30 seconds. A
service is not available for discovery by clients until the instance,
the server and the client all have the same metadata in their local
cache (so it could take 3 heartbeats). You can change the period using
<literal>eureka.instance.leaseRenewalIntervalInSeconds</literal> and this will speed up
the process of getting clients connected to other services. In
production it&#8217;s probably better to stick with the default because
there are some computations internally in the server that make
assumptions about the lease renewal period.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_zones">
<title>Zones</title>
<simpara>If you have deployed Eureka clients to multiple zones than you may prefer that
those clients leverage services within the same zone before trying services
in another zone.  To do this you need to configure your Eureka clients correctly.</simpara>
<simpara>First, you need to make sure you have Eureka servers deployed to each zone and that
they are peers of each other.  See the section on <link linkend="spring-cloud-eureka-server-zones-and-regions">zones and regions</link>
for more information.</simpara>
<simpara>Next you need to tell Eureka which zone your service is in.  You can do this using
the <literal>metadataMap</literal> property.  For example if <literal>service 1</literal> is deployed to both <literal>zone 1</literal>
and <literal>zone 2</literal> you would need to set the following Eureka properties in <literal>service 1</literal></simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Service 1 in Zone 1</emphasis></simpara>
<screen>eureka.instance.metadataMap.zone = zone1
eureka.client.preferSameZoneEureka = true</screen>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Service 1 in Zone 2</emphasis></simpara>

<tip>
<simpara>Due to Gradle&#8217;s dependency resolution rules and the lack of a parent bom feature, simply depending on spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server can cause failures on application startup.

<section xml:id="spring-cloud-eureka-server-zones-and-regions">
<title>High Availability, Zones and Regions</title>
<simpara>The Eureka server does not have a backend store, but the service
instances in the registry all have to send heartbeats to keep their
registrations up to date (so this can be done in memory). Clients also
have an in-memory cache of eureka registrations (so they don&#8217;t have to
go to the registry for every single request to a service).</simpara>
<simpara>By default every Eureka server is also a Eureka client and requires
(at least one) service URL to locate a peer. If you don&#8217;t provide it
the service will run and work, but it will shower your logs with a lot
of noise about not being able to register with the peer.</simpara>
<simpara>See also <link linkend="spring-cloud-ribbon">below for details of Ribbon
support</link> on the client side for Zones and Regions.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_standalone_mode">
<title>Standalone Mode</title>
<simpara>The combination of the two caches (client and server) and the
heartbeats make a standalone Eureka server fairly resilient to
failure, as long as there is some sort of monitor or elastic runtime
keeping it alive (e.g. Cloud Foundry). In standalone mode, you might
prefer to switch off the client side behaviour, so it doesn&#8217;t keep
trying and failing to reach its peers. Example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml (Standalone Eureka Server)</title>
<para>
<screen>server:
  port: 8761

eureka:
  instance:
    hostname: localhost
  client:
    registerWithEureka: false
    fetchRegistry: false
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://${eureka.instance.hostname}:${server.port}/eureka/</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Notice that the <literal>serviceUrl</literal> is pointing to the same host as the local
instance.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_peer_awareness">
<title>Peer Awareness</title>
<simpara>Eureka can be made even more resilient and available by running
multiple instances and asking them to register with each other. In
fact, this is the default behaviour, so all you need to do to make it
work is add a valid <literal>serviceUrl</literal> to a peer, e.g.</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml (Two Peer Aware Eureka Servers)</title>
<para>
<screen>---
spring:
  profiles: peer1
eureka:
  instance:
    hostname: peer1
  client:
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://peer2/eureka/

---
spring:
  profiles: peer2
eureka:
  instance:
    hostname: peer2
  client:
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://peer1/eureka/</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>In this example we have a YAML file that can be used to run the same
server on 2 hosts (peer1 and peer2), by running it in different
Spring profiles. You could use this configuration to test the peer
awareness on a single host (there&#8217;s not much value in doing that in
production) by manipulating <literal>/etc/hosts</literal> to resolve the host names. In
fact, the <literal>eureka.instance.hostname</literal> is not needed if you are running
on a machine that knows its own hostname (it is looked up using
<literal>java.net.InetAddress</literal> by default).</simpara>
<simpara>You can add multiple peers to a system, and as long as they are all
connected to each other by at least one edge, they will synchronize
the registrations amongst themselves. If the peers are physically
separated (inside a data centre or between multiple data centres) then
the system can in principle survive split-brain type failures.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_prefer_ip_address">
<title>Prefer IP Address</title>
<simpara>In some cases, it is preferable for Eureka to advertise the IP Adresses
of services rather than the hostname.  Set <literal>eureka.instance.preferIpAddress</literal>
to <literal>true</literal> and when the application registers with eureka, it will use its
IP Address rather than its hostname.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>If hostname can&#8217;t be determined by Java, then IP address is sent to Eureka.
Only explict way of setting hostname is by using <literal>eureka.instance.hostname</literal>.
You can set your hostname at the run time using environment variable, for
example <literal>eureka.instance.hostname=${HOST_NAME}</literal>.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_circuit_breaker_hystrix_clients">
<title>Circuit Breaker: Hystrix Clients</title>
<simpara>Netflix has created a library called <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix">Hystrix</link> that implements the <link xl:href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html">circuit breaker pattern</link>.  In a microservice architecture it is common to have multiple layers of service calls.</simpara>

</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>A service failure in the lower level of services can cause cascading failure all the way up to the user. When calls to a particular service is greater than <literal>circuitBreaker.requestVolumeThreshold</literal> (default: 20 requests) and failue percentage is greater than <literal>circuitBreaker.errorThresholdPercentage</literal> (default: &gt;50%) in a rolling window defined  by <literal>metrics.rollingStats.timeInMilliseconds</literal> (default: 10 seconds), the circuit opens and the call is not made.  In cases of error and an open circuit a fallback can be provided by the developer.</simpara>

</figure>
<simpara>Having an open circuit stops cascading failures and allows overwhelmed or failing services time to heal.  The fallback can be another Hystrix protected call, static data or a sane empty value.  Fallbacks may be chained so the first fallback makes some other business call which in turn falls back to static data.</simpara>

<title>How to Include Hystrix</title>

    public Object defaultStores(Map&lt;String, Object&gt; parameters) {

<simpara>The <literal>@HystrixCommand</literal> is provided by a Netflix contrib library called

breaker. The circuit breaker calculates when to open and close the
circuit, and what to do in case of a failure.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_propagating_the_security_context_or_using_spring_scopes">
<title>Propagating the Security Context or using Spring Scopes</title>
<simpara>If you want some thread local context to propagate into a <literal>@HystrixCommand</literal> the default declaration will not work because it executes the command in a thread pool (in case of timeouts). You can switch Hystrix to use the same thread as the caller using some configuration, or directly in the annotation, by asking it to use a different "Isolation Strategy". For example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "stubMyService",
    commandProperties = {
      @HystrixProperty(name="execution.isolation.strategy", value="SEMAPHORE")
    }

<simpara>The same thing applies if you are using <literal>@SessionScope</literal> or <literal>@RequestScope</literal>. You will know when you need to do this because of a runtime exception that says it can&#8217;t find the scoped context.</simpara>
<simpara>You also have the option to set the <literal>hystrix.shareSecurityContext</literal> property to <literal>true</literal>. Doing so will auto configure an Hystrix concurrency strategy plugin hook who will transfer the <literal>SecurityContext</literal> from your main thread to the one used by the Hystrix command. Hystrix does not allow multiple hystrix concurrency strategy to be registered so an extension mechanism is available by declaring your own <literal>HystrixConcurrencyStrategy</literal> as a Spring bean.

<simpara>When connecting to a <literal>/hystrix.stream</literal> endpoint which uses HTTPS the certificate used by the server

<section xml:id="_turbine">
<title>Turbine</title>
<simpara>Looking at an individual instances Hystrix data is not very useful in terms of the overall health of the system.  <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/Turbine">Turbine</link> is an application that aggregates all of the relevant <literal>/hystrix.stream</literal> endpoints into a combined <literal>/turbine.stream</literal> for use in the Hystrix Dashboard.  Individual instances are located via Eureka.  Running Turbine is as simple as annotating your main class with the <literal>@EnableTurbine</literal> annotation  (e.g. using spring-cloud-starter-netflix-turbine to set up the classpath).  All of the documented configuration properties from <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/Turbine/wiki/Configuration-(1.x)">the Turbine 1 wiki</link> apply.  The only difference is that the <literal>turbine.instanceUrlSuffix</literal> does not need the port prepended as this is handled automatically unless <literal>turbine.instanceInsertPort=false</literal>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>By default, Turbine looks for the <literal>/hystrix.stream</literal> endpoint on a registered instance by looking up its <literal>hostName</literal> and <literal>port</literal> entries in Eureka, then appending <literal>/hystrix.stream</literal> to it.
If the instance&#8217;s metadata contains <literal>management.port</literal>, it will be used instead of the <literal>port</literal> value for the <literal>/hystrix.stream</literal> endpoint.
By default, metadata entry <literal>management.port</literal> is equal to the <literal>management.port</literal> configuration property, it can be overridden though with following configuration:</simpara>
</note>
<screen>eureka:
  instance:
    metadata-map:
      management.port: ${management.port:8081}</screen>
<simpara>The configuration key <literal>turbine.appConfig</literal> is a list of eureka serviceIds that turbine will use to lookup instances.  The turbine stream is then used in the Hystrix dashboard using a url that looks like: <literal><link xl:href="http://my.turbine.sever:8080/turbine.stream?cluster=CLUSTERNAME">http://my.turbine.sever:8080/turbine.stream?cluster=CLUSTERNAME</link></literal> (the cluster parameter can be omitted if the name is "default"). The <literal>cluster</literal> parameter must match an entry in <literal>turbine.aggregator.clusterConfig</literal>. Values returned from eureka are uppercase, thus we expect this example to work if there is an app registered with Eureka called "customers":</simpara>
<screen>turbine:
  aggregator:
    clusterConfig: CUSTOMERS
  appConfig: customers</screen>
<simpara>If you need to customize which cluster names should be used by Turbine (you don&#8217;t want to store cluster names in
<literal>turbine.aggregator.clusterConfig</literal> configuration) provide a bean of type <literal>TurbineClustersProvider</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>clusterName</literal> can be customized by a SPEL expression in <literal>turbine.clusterNameExpression</literal> with root an instance of <literal>InstanceInfo</literal>. The default value is <literal>appName</literal>, which means that the Eureka serviceId ends up as the cluster key (i.e. the <literal>InstanceInfo</literal> for customers has an <literal>appName</literal> of "CUSTOMERS").  A different example would be <literal>turbine.clusterNameExpression=aSGName</literal>, which would get the cluster name from the AWS ASG name. Another example:</simpara>
<screen>turbine:
  aggregator:
    clusterConfig: SYSTEM,USER
  appConfig: customers,stores,ui,admin
  clusterNameExpression: metadata['cluster']</screen>
<simpara>In this case, the cluster name from 4 services is pulled from their metadata map, and is expected to have values that include "SYSTEM" and "USER".</simpara>
<simpara>To use the "default" cluster for all apps you need a string literal expression (with single quotes, and escaped with double quotes if it is in YAML as well):</simpara>
<screen>turbine:
  appConfig: customers,stores
  clusterNameExpression: "'default'"</screen>
<simpara>Spring Cloud provides a <literal>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-turbine</literal> that has all the dependencies you need to get a Turbine server running. Just create a Spring Boot application and annotate it with <literal>@EnableTurbine</literal>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>by default Spring Cloud allows Turbine to use the host and port to allow multiple processes per host, per cluster. If you want the native Netflix behaviour built into Turbine that does <emphasis>not</emphasis> allow multiple processes per host, per cluster (the key to the instance id is the hostname), then set the property <literal>turbine.combineHostPort=false</literal>.</simpara>

</section>
<section xml:id="_turbine_stream">
<title>Turbine Stream</title>
<simpara>In some environments (e.g. in a PaaS setting), the classic Turbine model of pulling metrics from all the distributed Hystrix commands doesn&#8217;t work. In that case you might want to have your Hystrix commands push metrics to Turbine, and Spring Cloud enables that with messaging. All you need to do on the client is add a dependency to <literal>spring-cloud-netflix-hystrix-stream</literal> and the <literal>spring-cloud-starter-stream-*</literal> of your choice (see Spring Cloud Stream documentation for details on the brokers, and how to configure the client credentials, but it should work out of the box for a local broker).</simpara>
<simpara>On the server side Just create a Spring Boot application and annotate it with <literal>@EnableTurbineStream</literal> and by default it will come up on port 8989 (point your Hystrix dashboard to that port, any path). You can customize the port using either <literal>server.port</literal> or <literal>turbine.stream.port</literal>. If you have <literal>spring-boot-starter-web</literal> and <literal>spring-boot-starter-actuator</literal> on the classpath as well, then you can open up the Actuator endpoints on a separate port (with Tomcat by default) by providing a <literal>management.port</literal> which is different.</simpara>
<simpara>You can then point the Hystrix Dashboard to the Turbine Stream Server instead of individual Hystrix streams.  If Turbine Stream is running on port 8989 on myhost, then put <literal><link xl:href="http://myhost:8989">http://myhost:8989</link></literal> in the stream input field in the Hystrix Dashboard. Circuits will be prefixed by their respective serviceId, followed by a dot, then the circuit name.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud provides a <literal>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-turbine-stream</literal> that has all the dependencies you need to get a Turbine Stream server running - just add the Stream binder of your choice, e.g. <literal>spring-cloud-starter-stream-rabbit</literal>.

<title>Client Side Load Balancer: Ribbon</title>
<simpara>Ribbon is a client side load balancer which gives you a lot of control
over the behaviour of HTTP and TCP clients. Feign already uses Ribbon,
so if you are using <literal>@FeignClient</literal> then this section also applies.</simpara>
<simpara>A central concept in Ribbon is that of the named client. Each load
balancer is part of an ensemble of components that work together to
contact a remote server on demand, and the ensemble has a name that
you give it as an application developer (e.g. using the <literal>@FeignClient</literal>
annotation). Spring Cloud creates a new ensemble as an
<literal>ApplicationContext</literal> on demand for each named client using
<literal>RibbonClientConfiguration</literal>. This contains (amongst other things) an
<literal>ILoadBalancer</literal>, a <literal>RestClient</literal>, and a <literal>ServerListFilter</literal>.</simpara>

<title>Customizing the Ribbon Client</title>
<simpara>You can configure some bits of a Ribbon client using external
properties in <literal>&lt;client&gt;.ribbon.*</literal>, which is no different than using
the Netflix APIs natively, except that you can use Spring Boot
configuration files. The native options can
be inspected as static fields in <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon/blob/master/ribbon-core/src/main/java/com/netflix/client/config/CommonClientConfigKey.java"><literal>CommonClientConfigKey</literal></link> (part of

<simpara>Spring Cloud also lets you take full control of the client by
declaring additional configuration (on top of the
<literal>RibbonClientConfiguration</literal>) using <literal>@RibbonClient</literal>. Example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Configuration
@RibbonClient(name = "foo", configuration = FooConfiguration.class)
public class TestConfiguration {
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In this case the client is composed from the components already in
<literal>RibbonClientConfiguration</literal> together with any in <literal>FooConfiguration</literal>
(where the latter generally will override the former).</simpara>
<warning>
<simpara>The <literal>FooConfiguration</literal> has to be <literal>@Configuration</literal> but take
care that it is not in a <literal>@ComponentScan</literal> for the main application
context, otherwise it will be shared by all the <literal>@RibbonClients</literal>. If
you use <literal>@ComponentScan</literal> (or <literal>@SpringBootApplication</literal>) you need to
take steps to avoid it being included (for instance put it in a
separate, non-overlapping package, or specify the packages to scan

<section xml:id="_using_ribbon_with_eureka">
<title>Using Ribbon with Eureka</title>
<simpara>When Eureka is used in conjunction with Ribbon (i.e., both are on the classpath) the <literal>ribbonServerList</literal>
is overridden with an extension of <literal>DiscoveryEnabledNIWSServerList</literal>
which populates the list of servers from Eureka.  It also replaces the
<literal>IPing</literal> interface with <literal>NIWSDiscoveryPing</literal> which delegates to Eureka
to determine if a server is up. The <literal>ServerList</literal> that is installed by
default is a <literal>DomainExtractingServerList</literal> and the purpose of this is
to make physical metadata available to the load balancer without using
AWS AMI metadata (which is what Netflix relies on). By default the
server list will be constructed with "zone" information as provided in
the instance metadata (so on the remote clients set
<literal>eureka.instance.metadataMap.zone</literal>), and if that is missing it can use
the domain name from the server hostname as a proxy for zone (if the
flag <literal>approximateZoneFromHostname</literal> is set). Once the zone information
is available it can be used in a <literal>ServerListFilter</literal>. By default it
will be used to locate a server in the same zone as the client because
the default is a <literal>ZonePreferenceServerListFilter</literal>. The zone of the
client is determined the same way as the remote instances by default,
i.e. via <literal>eureka.instance.metadataMap.zone</literal>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The orthodox "archaius" way to set the client zone is via a
configuration property called "@zone", and Spring Cloud will use that
in preference to all other settings if it is available (note that the
key will have to be quoted in YAML configuration).</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>If there is no other source of zone data then a guess is made
based on the client configuration (as opposed to the instance
configuration). We take <literal>eureka.client.availabilityZones</literal>, which is a
map from region name to a list of zones, and pull out the first zone
for the instance&#8217;s own region (i.e. the <literal>eureka.client.region</literal>, which
defaults to "us-east-1" for comatibility with native Netflix).</simpara>

<title>Declarative REST Client: Feign</title>
<simpara><link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/feign">Feign</link> is a declarative web service client.  It makes writing web service clients easier.  To use Feign create an interface and annotate it.  It has pluggable annotation support including Feign annotations and JAX-RS annotations. Feign also supports pluggable encoders and decoders.  Spring Cloud adds support for Spring MVC annotations and for using the same <literal>HttpMessageConverters</literal> used by default in Spring Web.  Spring Cloud integrates Ribbon and Eureka to provide a load balanced http client when using Feign.</simpara>
<section xml:id="netflix-feign-starter">
<title>How to Include Feign</title>
<simpara>To include Feign in your project use the starter with group <literal>org.springframework.cloud</literal>

for details on setting up your build system with the current Spring Cloud Release Train.</simpara>
<simpara>Example spring boot app</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Configuration
@ComponentScan

    Store update(@PathVariable("storeId") Long storeId, Store store);

</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>In the <literal>@FeignClient</literal> annotation the String value ("stores" above) is
an arbitrary client name, which is used to create a Ribbon load
balancer (see <link linkend="spring-cloud-ribbon">below for details of Ribbon
support</link>). You can also specify a URL using the <literal>url</literal> attribute
(absolute value or just a hostname). The name of the bean in the
application context is the fully qualified name of the interface.
To specify your own alias value you can use the <literal>qualifier</literal> value
of the <literal>@FeignClient</literal> annotation.</simpara>
<simpara>The Ribbon client above will want to discover the physical addresses
for the "stores" service. If your application is a Eureka client then
it will resolve the service in the Eureka service registry. If you
don&#8217;t want to use Eureka, you can simply configure a list of servers
in your external configuration (see
<link linkend="spring-cloud-ribbon-without-eureka">above for example</link>).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="spring-cloud-feign-overriding-defaults">
<title>Overriding Feign Defaults</title>
<simpara>A central concept in Spring Cloud&#8217;s Feign support is that of the named client. Each feign client is part of an ensemble of components that work together to contact a remote server on demand, and the ensemble has a name that you give it as an application developer using the <literal>@FeignClient</literal> annotation. Spring Cloud creates a new ensemble as an
<literal>ApplicationContext</literal> on demand for each named client using <literal>FeignClientsConfiguration</literal>. This contains (amongst other things) an <literal>feign.Decoder</literal>, a <literal>feign.Encoder</literal>, and a <literal>feign.Contract</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud lets you take full control of the feign client by declaring additional configuration (on top of the <literal>FeignClientsConfiguration</literal>) using <literal>@FeignClient</literal>. Example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@FeignClient(name = "stores", configuration = FooConfiguration.class)
public interface StoreClient {
    //..
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In this case the client is composed from the components already in <literal>FeignClientsConfiguration</literal> together with any in <literal>FooConfiguration</literal> (where the latter will override the former).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara><literal>FooConfiguration</literal> does not need to be annotated with <literal>@Configuration</literal>. However, if it is, then take care to exclude it from any <literal>@ComponentScan</literal> that would otherwise include this configuration as it will become the default source for <literal>feign.Decoder</literal>, <literal>feign.Encoder</literal>, <literal>feign.Contract</literal>, etc., when specified. This can be avoided by putting it in a separate, non-overlapping package from any <literal>@ComponentScan</literal> or <literal>@SpringBootApplication</literal>, or it can be explicitly excluded in <literal>@ComponentScan</literal>.</simpara>

<note>
<simpara>The <literal>serviceId</literal> attribute is now deprecated in favor of the <literal>name</literal> attribute.</simpara>

<section xml:id="netflix-zuul-reverse-proxy">
<title>Embedded Zuul Reverse Proxy</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud has created an embedded Zuul proxy to ease the
development of a very common use case where a UI application wants to
proxy calls to one or more back end services.  This feature is useful
for a user interface to proxy to the backend services it requires,
avoiding the need to manage CORS and authentication concerns
independently for all the backends.</simpara>
<simpara>To enable it, annotate a Spring Boot main class with
<literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal>, and this forwards local calls to the appropriate
service.  By convention, a service with the ID "users", will
receive requests from the proxy located at <literal>/users</literal> (with the prefix
stripped). The proxy uses Ribbon to locate an instance to forward to
via discovery, and all requests are executed in a
<link linkend="hystrix-fallbacks-for-routes">hystrix command</link>, so
failures will show up in Hystrix metrics, and once the circuit is open
the proxy will not try to contact the service.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>the Zuul starter does not include a discovery client, so for
routes based on service IDs you need to provide one of those
on the classpath as well (e.g. Eureka is one choice).</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>To skip having a service automatically added, set
<literal>zuul.ignored-services</literal> to a list of service id patterns. If a service
matches a pattern that is ignored, but also included in the explicitly
configured routes map, then it will be unignored. Example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  ignoredServices: '*'
  routes:
    users: /myusers/**</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>In this example, all services are ignored <emphasis role="strong">except</emphasis> "users".</simpara>
<simpara>To augment or change
the proxy routes, you can add external configuration like the
following:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    users: /myusers/**</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>This means that http calls to "/myusers" get forwarded to the "users"
service (for example "/myusers/101" is forwarded to "/101").</simpara>
<simpara>To get more fine-grained control over a route you can specify the path
and the serviceId independently:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
      serviceId: users_service</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>This means that http calls to "/myusers" get forwarded to the
"users_service" service.  The route has to have a "path" which can be
specified as an ant-style pattern, so "/myusers/*" only matches one
level, but "/myusers/**" matches hierarchically.</simpara>
<simpara>The location of the backend can be specified as either a "serviceId"
(for a service from discovery) or a "url" (for a physical location), e.g.</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
      url: http://example.com/users_service</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>These simple url-routes don&#8217;t get executed as a <literal>HystrixCommand</literal> nor do they loadbalance multiple URLs with Ribbon.
To achieve this, you can specify a <literal>serviceId</literal> with a static list of servers:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">zuul:
  routes:
    echo:
      path: /myusers/**
      serviceId: myusers-service
      stripPrefix: true

hystrix:
  command:
    myusers-service:
      execution:
        isolation:
          thread:
            timeoutInMilliseconds: ...

myusers-service:
  ribbon:
    NIWSServerListClassName: com.netflix.loadbalancer.ConfigurationBasedServerList
    ListOfServers: http://example1.com,http://example2.com
    ConnectTimeout: 1000
    ReadTimeout: 3000
    MaxTotalHttpConnections: 500
    MaxConnectionsPerHost: 100</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Another method is specifiying a service-route and configure a Ribbon client for the
serviceId (this requires disabling Eureka support in Ribbon:
see <link linkend="spring-cloud-ribbon-without-eureka">above for more information</link>), e.g.</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
      serviceId: users

ribbon:
  eureka:
    enabled: false

users:
  ribbon:
    listOfServers: example.com,google.com</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>You can provide convention between serviceId and routes using
regexmapper.  It uses regular expression named groups to extract
variables from serviceId and inject them into a route pattern.</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>ApplicationConfiguration.java</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public PatternServiceRouteMapper serviceRouteMapper() {
    return new PatternServiceRouteMapper(
        "(?&lt;name&gt;^.+)-(?&lt;version&gt;v.+$)",
        "${version}/${name}");
}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>This means that a serviceId "myusers-v1" will be mapped to route
"/v1/myusers/**".  Any regular expression is accepted but all named
groups must be present in both servicePattern and routePattern.  If
servicePattern does not match a serviceId, the default behavior is
used. In the example above, a serviceId "myusers" will be mapped to route
"/myusers/**" (no version detected) This feature is disabled by
default and only applies to discovered services.</simpara>
<simpara>To add a prefix to all mappings, set <literal>zuul.prefix</literal> to a value, such as
<literal>/api</literal>. The proxy prefix is stripped from the request before the
request is forwarded by default (switch this behaviour off with
<literal>zuul.stripPrefix=false</literal>). You can also switch off the stripping of
the service-specific prefix from individual routes, e.g.</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
      stripPrefix: false</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<note>
<simpara><literal>zuul.stripPrefix</literal> only applies to the prefix set in <literal>zuul.prefix</literal>.  It does not have any effect on prefixes
defined within a given route&#8217;s <literal>path</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>In this example, requests to "/myusers/101" will be forwarded to "/myusers/101" on the "users" service.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>zuul.routes</literal> entries actually bind to an object of type <literal>ZuulProperties</literal>. If you
look at the properties of that object you will see that it also has a "retryable" flag.
Set that flag to "true" to have the Ribbon client automatically retry failed requests
(and if you need to you can modify the parameters of the retry operations using
the Ribbon client configuration).</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>X-Forwarded-Host</literal> header is added to the forwarded requests by
default.  To turn it off set <literal>zuul.addProxyHeaders = false</literal>.  The
prefix path is stripped by default, and the request to the backend
picks up a header "X-Forwarded-Prefix" ("/myusers" in the examples
above).</simpara>
<simpara>An application with <literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal> could act as a standalone
server if you set a default route ("/"), for example <literal>zuul.route.home:
/</literal> would route all traffic (i.e. "/**") to the "home" service.</simpara>
<simpara>If more fine-grained ignoring is needed, you can specify specific patterns to ignore.
These patterns are evaluated at the start of the route location process, which
means prefixes should be included in the pattern to warrant a match. Ignored patterns
span all services and supersede any other route specification.</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  ignoredPatterns: /**/admin/**
  routes:
    users: /myusers/**</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>This means that all calls such as "/myusers/101" will be forwarded to "/101" on the "users" service.
But calls including "/admin/" will not resolve.</simpara>
<warning>
<simpara>If you need your routes to have their order preserved you need to use a YAML
file as the ordering will be lost using a properties file. For example:</simpara>
</warning>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
    legacy:
      path: /**</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>If you were to use a properties file, the <literal>legacy</literal> path may end up in front of the <literal>users</literal>
path rendering the <literal>users</literal> path unreachable.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_cookies_and_sensitive_headers">
<title>Cookies and Sensitive Headers</title>
<simpara>It&#8217;s OK to share headers between services in the same system, but you
probably don&#8217;t want sensitive headers leaking downstream into external
servers. You can specify a list of ignored headers as part of the
route configuration. Cookies play a special role because they have
well-defined semantics in browsers, and they are always to be treated
as sensitive. If the consumer of your proxy is a browser, then cookies
for downstream services also cause problems for the user because they
all get jumbled up (all downstream services look like they come from
the same place).</simpara>
<simpara>If you are careful with the design of your services, for example if
only one of the downstream services sets cookies, then you might be
able to let them flow from the backend all the way up to the
caller. Also, if your proxy sets cookies and all your back end
services are part of the same system, it can be natural to simply
share them (and for instance use Spring Session to link them up to some
shared state). Other than that, any cookies that get set by downstream
services are likely to be not very useful to the caller, so it is
recommended that you make (at least) "Set-Cookie" and "Cookie" into
sensitive headers for routes that are not part of your domain. Even
for routes that <emphasis role="strong">are</emphasis> part of your domain, try to think carefully
about what it means before allowing cookies to flow between them and
the proxy.</simpara>
<simpara>The sensitive headers can be configured as a comma-separated list per
route, e.g.</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
      sensitiveHeaders: Cookie,Set-Cookie,Authorization
      url: https://downstream</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<note>
<simpara>this is the default value for <literal>sensitiveHeaders</literal>, so you don&#8217;t
need to set it unless you want it to be different. N.B. this is new in
Spring Cloud Netflix 1.1 (in 1.0 the user had no control over headers
and all cookies flow in both directions).</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>The <literal>sensitiveHeaders</literal> are a blacklist and the default is not empty,
so to make Zuul send all headers (except the "ignored" ones) you would
have to explicitly set it to the empty list. This is necessary if you
want to pass cookie or authorization headers to your back end. Example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
      sensitiveHeaders:
      url: https://downstream</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Sensitive headers can also be set globally by setting <literal>zuul.sensitiveHeaders</literal>. If <literal>sensitiveHeaders</literal> is set on a route, this will override the global <literal>sensitiveHeaders</literal> setting.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_ignored_headers">
<title>Ignored Headers</title>
<simpara>In addition to the per-route sensitive headers, you can set a global
value for <literal>zuul.ignoredHeaders</literal> for values that should be discarded
(both request and response) during interactions with downstream
services. By default these are empty, if Spring Security is not on the
classpath, and otherwise they are initialized to a set of well-known
"security" headers (e.g. involving caching) as specified by Spring
Security. The assumption in this case is that the downstream services
might add these headers too, and we want the values from the proxy.
To not discard these well known security headers in case Spring Security is on the classpath you can set <literal>zuul.ignoreSecurityHeaders</literal> to <literal>false</literal>. This can be useful if you disabled the HTTP Security response headers in Spring Security and want the values provided by downstream services</simpara>

<title>Strangulation Patterns and Local Forwards</title>
<simpara>A common pattern when migrating an existing application or API is to
"strangle" old endpoints, slowly replacing them with different
implementations. The Zuul proxy is a useful tool for this because you
can use it to handle all traffic from clients of the old endpoints,
but redirect some of the requests to new ones.</simpara>
<simpara>Example configuration:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered"> zuul:
  routes:
    first:
      path: /first/**
      url: http://first.example.com
    second:
      path: /second/**
      url: forward:/second
    third:
      path: /third/**
      url: forward:/3rd
    legacy:
      path: /**
      url: http://legacy.example.com</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>In this example we are strangling the "legacy" app which is mapped to
all requests that do not match one of the other patterns. Paths in
<literal>/first/**</literal> have been extracted into a new service with an external
URL. And paths in <literal>/second/**</literal> are forwarded so they can be handled
locally, e.g. with a normal Spring <literal>@RequestMapping</literal>. Paths in
<literal>/third/**</literal> are also forwarded, but with a different prefix
(i.e. <literal>/third/foo</literal> is forwarded to <literal>/3rd/foo</literal>).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The ignored patterns aren&#8217;t completely ignored, they just
aren&#8217;t handled by the proxy (so they are also effectively forwarded
locally).</simpara>

<section xml:id="_uploading_files_through_zuul">
<title>Uploading Files through Zuul</title>
<simpara>If you <literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal> you can use the proxy paths to
upload files and it should just work as long as the files

which bypasses the Spring <literal>DispatcherServlet</literal> (to
avoid multipart processing) in "/zuul/*". I.e. if

POST large files to "/zuul/customers/*". The servlet

large files will also require elevated timeout settings

<simpara>Note that for streaming to work with large files, you need to use chunked encoding in the request (which some browsers
do not do by default). E.g. on the command line:</simpara>
<screen>$ curl -v -H "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" \
    -F "file=@mylarge.iso" localhost:9999/zuul/simple/file</screen>

<section xml:id="_query_string_encoding">
<title>Query String Encoding</title>
<simpara>When processing the incoming request, query params are decoded so they can be available for possible modifications in
Zuul filters. They are then re-encoded when building the backend request in the route filters. The result
can be different than the original input if it was encoded using Javascript&#8217;s <literal>encodeURIComponent()</literal> method for example.
While this causes no issues in most cases, some web servers can be picky with the encoding of complex query string.</simpara>
<simpara>To force the original encoding of the query string, it is possible to pass a special flag to <literal>ZuulProperties</literal> so
that the query string is taken as is with the <literal>HttpServletRequest::getQueryString</literal> method :</simpara>
<formalpara>

<title>Zuul Timeouts</title>
<section xml:id="_service_discovery_configuration">
<title>Service Discovery Configuration</title>
<simpara>If Zuul is using service discovery there are two timeouts you need to be concerned
with, the Hystrix timeout (since all routes are wrapped in Hystrix commands by default)
and the Ribbon timeout.  The Hystrix timeout needs to take into account the Ribbon
read and connect timeout PLUS the total number of retries that will happen for that
service.  By default Spring Cloud Zuul will do its best to calculate the Hystrix timeout
for you <emphasis role="strong">UNLESS</emphasis> you specify the Hystrix timeout explicitly.</simpara>
<simpara>The Hystrix timeout is calculated using the following formula:</simpara>
<screen>(ribbon.ConnectTimeout + ribbon.ReadTimeout) * (ribbon.MaxAutoRetries + 1) * (ribbon.MaxAutoRetriesNextServer + 1)</screen>
<simpara>As an example, if you set the following properties in your application properties</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>ribbon:
  ReadTimeout:100
  ConnectTimeout:500
  MaxAutoRetries:1
  MaxAutoRetriesNextServer:1</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Then the Hystrix timeout (for all routes in this case) will be set to <literal>2400ms.</literal></simpara>
<note>
<simpara>You can configure the Hystrix timeout for individual routes using <literal>service.ribbon.*</literal> properties.</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>If you choose to not configure the above properties than the default values will be used therefore the
default Hystrix timeout will be set to <literal>4000ms</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>If you set <literal>hystrix.command.commandKey.execution.isolation.thread.timeoutInMilliseconds</literal>, where
<literal>commandKey</literal> is the route id, or set <literal>hystrix.command.default.execution.isolation.thread.timeoutInMilliseconds</literal>
than these values will be used for the Hystrix timeout regardless of what you have set for the <literal>ribbon.*</literal> properties.
If you set either of these properties <emphasis role="strong">YOU</emphasis> are responsible for making sure it takes
into account the Ribbon connect and read timeouts as well as any retries that may happen.</simpara>

<section xml:id="zuul-redirect-location-rewrite">
<title>Rewriting <literal>Location</literal> header</title>
<simpara>If Zuul is fronting a web application then there may be a need to re-write the <literal>Location</literal> header when the web application redirects through a http status code of 3XX, otherwise the browser will end up redirecting to the web application&#8217;s url instead of the Zuul url.
A <literal>LocationRewriteFilter</literal> Zuul filter can  be configured to re-write the Location header to the Zuul&#8217;s url, it also adds back the stripped global and route specific prefixes. The filter can be added the following way via a Spring Configuration file:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.zuul.filters.post.LocationRewriteFilter;
...

@Configuration
@EnableZuulProxy
public class ZuulConfig {
    @Bean
    public LocationRewriteFilter locationRewriteFilter() {
        return new LocationRewriteFilter();
    }
}</programlisting>
<warning>
<simpara>Use this filter with caution though, the filter acts on the <literal>Location</literal> header of ALL 3XX response codes which may not be appropriate in all scenarios, say if the user is redirecting to an external URL.</simpara>

<title>The Zuul Servlet</title>
<simpara>Zuul is implemented as a Servlet. For the general cases, Zuul is embedded into the Spring Dispatch mechanism. This allows Spring MVC to be in control of the routing. In this case, Zuul is configured to buffer requests. If there is a need to go through Zuul without buffering requests (e.g. for large file uploads), the Servlet is also installed outside of the Spring Dispatcher. By default, this is located at <literal>/zuul</literal>. This path can be changed with the <literal>zuul.servlet-path</literal> property.</simpara>

<title>Polyglot support with Sidecar</title>
<simpara>Do you have non-jvm languages you want to take advantage of Eureka, Ribbon and
Config Server?  The Spring Cloud Netflix Sidecar was inspired by
<link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/Prana">Netflix Prana</link>.  It includes a simple http api
to get all of the instances (ie host and port) for a given service.  You can
also proxy service calls through an embedded Zuul proxy which gets its route
entries from Eureka.  The Spring Cloud Config Server can be accessed directly
via host lookup or through the Zuul Proxy.  The non-jvm app should implement
a health check so the Sidecar can report to eureka if the app is up or down.</simpara>
<simpara>To include Sidecar in your project use the dependency with group <literal>org.springframework.cloud</literal>
and artifact id <literal>spring-cloud-netflix-sidecar</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To enable the Sidecar, create a Spring Boot application with <literal>@EnableSidecar</literal>.
This annotation includes <literal>@EnableCircuitBreaker</literal>, <literal>@EnableDiscoveryClient</literal>,
and <literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal>.  Run the resulting application on the same host as the
non-jvm application.</simpara>
<simpara>To configure the side car add <literal>sidecar.port</literal> and <literal>sidecar.health-uri</literal> to <literal>application.yml</literal>.
The <literal>sidecar.port</literal> property is the port the non-jvm app is listening on.  This
is so the Sidecar can properly register the app with Eureka.  The <literal>sidecar.health-uri</literal>
is a uri accessible on the non-jvm app that mimicks a Spring Boot health
indicator.  It should return a json document like the following:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>health-uri-document</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
  "status":"UP"

<simpara>The Zuul proxy automatically adds routes for each service known in eureka to

<blockquote>
<simpara>RxJava is a Java VM implementation of <link xl:href="http://reactivex.io/">Reactive Extensions</link>: a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.</simpara>
</blockquote>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Netflix provides support for returning <literal>rx.Single</literal> objects from Spring MVC Controllers. It also supports using <literal>rx.Observable</literal> objects for <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events">Server-sent events (SSE)</link>. This can be very convenient if your internal APIs are already built using RxJava (see <xref linkend="spring-cloud-feign-hystrix"/> for examples).</simpara>
<simpara>Here are some examples of using <literal>rx.Single</literal>:</simpara>

@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value = "/throw")
public Single&lt;Object&gt; error() {

<simpara>If you have an <literal>Observable</literal>, rather than a single, you can use <literal>.toSingle()</literal> or <literal>.toList().toSingle()</literal>. Here are some examples:</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="netflix-metrics">
<title>Metrics: Spectator, Servo, and Atlas</title>
<simpara>When used together, Spectator/Servo and Atlas provide a near real-time operational insight platform.</simpara>
<simpara>Spectator and Servo are Netflix&#8217;s metrics collection libraries. Atlas is a Netflix metrics backend to manage dimensional time series data.</simpara>
<simpara>Servo served Netflix for several years and is still usable, but is gradually being phased out in favor of Spectator, which is only designed to work with Java 8.  Spring Cloud Netflix provides support for both, but Java 8 based applications are encouraged to use Spectator.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_dimensional_vs_hierarchical_metrics">
<title>Dimensional vs. Hierarchical Metrics</title>
<simpara>Spring Boot Actuator metrics are hierarchical and metrics are separated only by name. These names often follow a naming convention that embeds key/value attribute pairs (dimensions) into the name separated by periods. Consider the following metrics for two endpoints, root and star-star:</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
    "counter.status.200.root": 20,
    "counter.status.400.root": 3,
    "counter.status.200.star-star": 5,
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The first metric gives us a normalized count of successful requests against the root endpoint per unit of time. But what if the system had 20 endpoints and you want to get a count of successful requests against all the endpoints? Some hierarchical metrics backends would allow you to specify a wild card such as <literal>counter.status.200.*</literal> that would read all 20 metrics and aggregate the results. Alternatively, you could provide a <literal>HandlerInterceptorAdapter</literal> that intercepts and records a metric like <literal>counter.status.200.all</literal> for all successful requests irrespective of the endpoint, but now you must write 20+1 different metrics. Similarly if you want to know the total number of successful requests for all endpoints in the service, you could specify a wild card such as <literal>counter.status.2*.*</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Even in the presence of wildcarding support on a hierarchical metrics backend, naming consistency can be difficult. Specifically the position of these tags in the name string can slip with time, breaking queries. For example, suppose we add an additional dimension to the hierarchical metrics above for HTTP method. Then <literal>counter.status.200.root</literal> becomes <literal>counter.status.200.method.get.root</literal>, etc. Our <literal>counter.status.200.*</literal> suddenly no longer has the same semantic meaning.  Furthermore, if the new dimension is not applied uniformly across the codebase, certain queries may become impossible. This can quickly get out of hand.</simpara>
<simpara>Netflix metrics are tagged (a.k.a. dimensional). Each metric has a name, but this single named metric can contain multiple statistics and 'tag' key/value pairs that allows more querying flexibility. In fact, the statistics themselves are recorded in a special tag.</simpara>
<simpara>Recorded with Netflix Servo or Spectator, a timer for the root endpoint described above contains 4 statistics per status code, where the count statistic is identical to Spring Boot Actuator&#8217;s counter. In the event that we have encountered an HTTP 200 and 400 thus far, there will be 8 available data points:</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
    "root(status=200,stastic=count)": 20,
    "root(status=200,stastic=max)": 0.7265630630000001,
    "root(status=200,stastic=totalOfSquares)": 0.04759702862580789,
    "root(status=200,stastic=totalTime)": 0.2093076914666667,
    "root(status=400,stastic=count)": 1,
    "root(status=400,stastic=max)": 0,

<simpara>In Spectator parlance, a meter is a named, typed, and tagged configuration and a metric represents the value of a given meter at a point in time. Spectator meters are created and controlled by a registry, which currently has several different implementations. Spectator provides 4 meter types: counter, timer, gauge, and distribution summary.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Spectator integration configures an injectable <literal>com.netflix.spectator.api.Registry</literal> instance for you. Specifically, it configures a <literal>ServoRegistry</literal> instance in order to unify the collection of REST metrics and the exporting of metrics to the Atlas backend under a single Servo API. Practically, this means that your code may use a mixture of Servo monitors and Spectator meters and both will be scooped up by Spring Boot Actuator <literal>MetricReader</literal> instances and both will be shipped to the Atlas backend.</simpara>

<simpara>Gauges are used to determine some current value like the size of a queue or number of threads in a running state. Since gauges are sampled, they provide no information about how these values fluctuate between samples.</simpara>
<simpara>The normal use of a gauge involves registering the gauge once in initialization with an id, a reference to the object to be sampled, and a function to get or compute a numeric value based on the object. The reference to the object is passed in separately and the Spectator registry will keep a weak reference to the object. If the object is garbage collected, then Spectator will automatically drop the registration. See <link xl:href="https://github.com/Netflix/spectator/wiki/Gauge-Usage#using-lambda">the note</link> in Spectator&#8217;s documentation about potential memory leaks if this API is misused.</simpara>

It covers topics such as creating and running stream applications.</simpara>
</partintro>
<chapter xml:id="_introducing_spring_cloud_stream">
<title>Introducing Spring Cloud Stream</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building message-driven microservice applications.
Spring Cloud Stream builds upon Spring Boot to create standalone, production-grade Spring applications, and uses Spring Integration to provide connectivity to message brokers.
It provides opinionated configuration of middleware from several vendors, introducing the concepts of persistent publish-subscribe semantics, consumer groups, and partitions.</simpara>
<simpara>You can add the <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> annotation to your application to get immediate connectivity to a message broker, and you can add <literal>@StreamListener</literal> to a method to cause it to receive events for stream processing.
The following is a simple sink application which receives external messages.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public class VoteRecordingSinkApplication {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(VoteRecordingSinkApplication.class, args);
  }

  @StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)
  public void processVote(Vote vote) {
      votingService.recordVote(vote);
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> annotation takes one or more interfaces as parameters (in this case, the parameter is a single <literal>Sink</literal> interface).
An interface declares input and/or output channels.
Spring Cloud Stream provides the interfaces <literal>Source</literal>, <literal>Sink</literal>, and <literal>Processor</literal>; you can also define your own interfaces.</simpara>
<simpara>The following is the definition of the <literal>Sink</literal> interface:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface Sink {
  String INPUT = "input";

  @Input(Sink.INPUT)
  SubscribableChannel input();
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>@Input</literal> annotation identifies an <emphasis>input channel</emphasis>, through which received messages enter the application; the <literal>@Output</literal> annotation identifies an <emphasis>output channel</emphasis>, through which published messages leave the application.
The <literal>@Input</literal> and <literal>@Output</literal> annotations can take a channel name as a parameter; if a name is not provided, the name of the annotated method will be used.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream will create an implementation of the interface for you.
You can use this in the application by autowiring it, as in the following example of a test case.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@SpringApplicationConfiguration(classes = VoteRecordingSinkApplication.class)
@WebAppConfiguration
@DirtiesContext
public class StreamApplicationTests {

  @Autowired
  private Sink sink;

  @Test
  public void contextLoads() {
    assertNotNull(this.sink.input());
  }
}</programlisting>

<title>Application Model</title>
<simpara>A Spring Cloud Stream application consists of a middleware-neutral core.
The application communicates with the outside world through input and output <emphasis>channels</emphasis> injected into it by Spring Cloud Stream.
Channels are connected to external brokers through middleware-specific Binder implementations.</simpara>

</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="_the_binder_abstraction">
<title>The Binder Abstraction</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides Binder implementations for <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/tree/master/spring-cloud-stream-binders/spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka">Kafka</link> and <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/tree/master/spring-cloud-stream-binders/spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit">Rabbit MQ</link>.
Spring Cloud Stream also includes a <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/blob/master/spring-cloud-stream-test-support/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/stream/test/binder/TestSupportBinder.java">TestSupportBinder</link>, which leaves a channel unmodified so that tests can interact with channels directly and reliably assert on what is received.
You can use the extensible API to write your own Binder.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream uses Spring Boot for configuration, and the Binder abstraction makes it possible for a Spring Cloud Stream application to be flexible in how it connects to middleware.
For example, deployers can dynamically choose, at runtime, the destinations (e.g., the Kafka topics or RabbitMQ exchanges) to which channels connect.
Such configuration can be provided through external configuration properties and in any form supported by Spring Boot (including application arguments, environment variables, and <literal>application.yml</literal> or <literal>application.properties</literal> files).
In the sink example from the <xref linkend="_introducing_spring_cloud_stream"/> section, setting the application property <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination</literal> to <literal>raw-sensor-data</literal> will cause it to read from the <literal>raw-sensor-data</literal> Kafka topic, or from a queue bound to the <literal>raw-sensor-data</literal> RabbitMQ exchange.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream automatically detects and uses a binder found on the classpath.
You can easily use different types of middleware with the same code: just include a different binder at build time.
For more complex use cases, you can also package multiple binders with your application and have it choose the binder, and even whether to use different binders for different channels, at runtime.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_persistent_publish_subscribe_support">
<title>Persistent Publish-Subscribe Support</title>
<simpara>Communication between applications follows a publish-subscribe model, where data is broadcast through shared topics.
This can be seen in the following figure, which shows a typical deployment for a set of interacting Spring Cloud Stream applications.</simpara>
<figure>
<title>Spring Cloud Stream Publish-Subscribe</title>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/SCSt-sensors.png" contentwidth="300" width="50%" scalefit="1"/>
</imageobject>
<textobject><phrase>SCSt sensors</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>Data reported by sensors to an HTTP endpoint is sent to a common destination named <literal>raw-sensor-data</literal>.
From the destination, it is independently processed by a microservice application that computes time-windowed averages and by another microservice application that ingests the raw data into HDFS.
In order to process the data, both applications declare the topic as their input at runtime.</simpara>
<simpara>The publish-subscribe communication model reduces the complexity of both the producer and the consumer, and allows new applications to be added to the topology without disruption of the existing flow.
For example, downstream from the average-calculating application, you can add an application that calculates the highest temperature values for display and monitoring.
You can then add another application that interprets the same flow of averages for fault detection.
Doing all communication through shared topics rather than point-to-point queues reduces coupling between microservices.</simpara>
<simpara>While the concept of publish-subscribe messaging is not new, Spring Cloud Stream takes the extra step of making it an opinionated choice for its application model.
By using native middleware support, Spring Cloud Stream also simplifies use of the publish-subscribe model across different platforms.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="consumer-groups">
<title>Consumer Groups</title>
<simpara>While the publish-subscribe model makes it easy to connect applications through shared topics, the ability to scale up by creating multiple instances of a given application is equally important.
When doing this, different instances of an application are placed in a competing consumer relationship, where only one of the instances is expected to handle a given message.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream models this behavior through the concept of a <emphasis>consumer group</emphasis>.
(Spring Cloud Stream consumer groups are similar to and inspired by Kafka consumer groups.)
Each consumer binding can use the <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.&lt;channelName&gt;.group</literal> property to specify a group name.
For the consumers shown in the following figure, this property would be set as <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.&lt;channelName&gt;.group=hdfsWrite</literal> or <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.&lt;channelName&gt;.group=average</literal>.</simpara>
<figure>
<title>Spring Cloud Stream Consumer Groups</title>

<imagedata fileref="images/SCSt-groups.png" contentwidth="300" width="50%" scalefit="1"/>
</imageobject>
<textobject><phrase>SCSt groups</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>All groups which subscribe to a given destination receive a copy of published data, but only one member of each group receives a given message from that destination.
By default, when a group is not specified, Spring Cloud Stream assigns the application to an anonymous and independent single-member consumer group that is in a publish-subscribe relationship with all other consumer groups.</simpara>
<section xml:id="durability">
<title>Durability</title>
<simpara>Consistent with the opinionated application model of Spring Cloud Stream, consumer group subscriptions are <emphasis>durable</emphasis>.
That is, a binder implementation ensures that group subscriptions are persistent, and once at least one subscription for a group has been created, the group will receive messages, even if they are sent while all applications in the group are stopped.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Anonymous subscriptions are non-durable by nature.
For some binder implementations (e.g., RabbitMQ), it is possible to have non-durable group subscriptions.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>In general, it is preferable to always specify a consumer group when binding an application to a given destination.
When scaling up a Spring Cloud Stream application, you must specify a consumer group for each of its input bindings.
This prevents the application&#8217;s instances from receiving duplicate messages (unless that behavior is desired, which is unusual).</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="partitioning">
<title>Partitioning Support</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides support for <emphasis>partitioning</emphasis> data between multiple instances of a given application.
In a partitioned scenario, the physical communication medium (e.g., the broker topic) is viewed as being structured into multiple partitions.
One or more producer application instances send data to multiple consumer application instances and ensure that data identified by common characteristics are processed by the same consumer instance.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides a common abstraction for implementing partitioned processing use cases in a uniform fashion.
Partitioning can thus be used whether the broker itself is naturally partitioned (e.g., Kafka) or not (e.g., RabbitMQ).</simpara>
<figure>
<title>Spring Cloud Stream Partitioning</title>

<imagedata fileref="images/SCSt-partitioning.png" contentwidth="300" width="50%" scalefit="1"/>
</imageobject>
<textobject><phrase>SCSt partitioning</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>Partitioning is a critical concept in stateful processing, where it is critiical, for either performance or consistency reasons, to ensure that all related data is processed together.
For example, in the time-windowed average calculation example, it is important that all measurements from any given sensor are processed by the same application instance.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>To set up a partitioned processing scenario, you must configure both the data-producing and the data-consuming ends.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_programming_model">
<title>Programming Model</title>
<simpara>This section describes Spring Cloud Stream&#8217;s programming model.
Spring Cloud Stream provides a number of predefined annotations for declaring bound input and output channels as well as how to listen to channels.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_declaring_and_binding_channels">
<title>Declaring and Binding Channels</title>
<section xml:id="_triggering_binding_via_literal_enablebinding_literal">
<title>Triggering Binding Via <literal>@EnableBinding</literal></title>
<simpara>You can turn a Spring application into a Spring Cloud Stream application by applying the <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> annotation to one of the application&#8217;s configuration classes.
The <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> annotation itself is meta-annotated with <literal>@Configuration</literal> and triggers the configuration of Spring Cloud Stream infrastructure:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">...
@Import(...)
@Configuration
@EnableIntegration
public @interface EnableBinding {
    ...
    Class&lt;?&gt;[] value() default {};
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> annotation can take as parameters one or more interface classes that contain methods which represent bindable components (typically message channels).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> annotation is only required on your <literal>Configuration</literal> classes, you can provide as many binding interfaces as you need, for instance: <literal>@EnableBinding(value={Orders.class, Payment.class}</literal>.
Where both <literal>Order</literal> and <literal>Payment</literal> interfaces would declare <literal>@Input</literal> and <literal>@Output</literal> channels.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="__literal_input_literal_and_literal_output_literal">
<title><literal>@Input</literal> and <literal>@Output</literal></title>
<simpara>A Spring Cloud Stream application can have an arbitrary number of input and output channels defined in an interface as <literal>@Input</literal> and <literal>@Output</literal> methods:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface Barista {

    @Input
    SubscribableChannel orders();

    @Output
    MessageChannel hotDrinks();

    @Output
    MessageChannel coldDrinks();
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Using this interface as a parameter to <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> will trigger the creation of three bound channels named <literal>orders</literal>, <literal>hotDrinks</literal>, and <literal>coldDrinks</literal>, respectively.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Barista.class)
public class CafeConfiguration {

   ...
}</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>In Spring Cloud Stream, the bindable <literal>MessageChannel</literal> components are the Spring Messaging <literal>MessageChannel</literal> (for outbound) and its extension <literal>SubscribableChannel</literal> (for inbound).
Using the same mechanism other bindable components can be supported.
<literal>KStream</literal> support in Spring Cloud Stream Kafka binder is one such example where KStream is used as inbound/outbound <literal>bindable</literal> components.
In this documentation, we will continue to refer to MessageChannels as the <literal>bindable</literal> components.</simpara>
</note>
<section xml:id="_customizing_channel_names">
<title>Customizing Channel Names</title>
<simpara>Using the <literal>@Input</literal> and <literal>@Output</literal> annotations, you can specify a customized channel name for the channel, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface Barista {
    ...
    @Input("inboundOrders")
    SubscribableChannel orders();
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In this example, the created bound channel will be named <literal>inboundOrders</literal>.</simpara>

<section xml:id="__literal_source_literal_literal_sink_literal_and_literal_processor_literal">
<title><literal>Source</literal>, <literal>Sink</literal>, and <literal>Processor</literal></title>
<simpara>For easy addressing of the most common use cases, which involve either an input channel, an output channel, or both, Spring Cloud Stream provides three predefined interfaces out of the box.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>Source</literal> can be used for an application which has a single outbound channel.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface Source {

<title>Accessing Bound Channels</title>
<section xml:id="_injecting_the_bound_interfaces">

<simpara>For each bound interface, Spring Cloud Stream will generate a bean that implements the interface.
Invoking a <literal>@Input</literal>-annotated or <literal>@Output</literal>-annotated method of one of these beans will return the relevant bound channel.</simpara>
<simpara>The bean in the following example sends a message on the output channel when its <literal>hello</literal> method is invoked.

    private Source source;

    @Autowired
    public SendingBean(Source source) {
        this.source = source;

<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface CustomSource {
    ...
    @Output("customOutput")
    MessageChannel output();
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The channel will be injected as shown in the following example:</simpara>

<section xml:id="_producing_and_consuming_messages">
<title>Producing and Consuming Messages</title>
<simpara>You can write a Spring Cloud Stream application using either Spring Integration annotations or Spring Cloud Stream&#8217;s <literal>@StreamListener</literal> annotation.
The <literal>@StreamListener</literal> annotation is modeled after other Spring Messaging annotations (such as <literal>@MessageMapping</literal>, <literal>@JmsListener</literal>, <literal>@RabbitListener</literal>, etc.) but adds content type management and type coercion features.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_native_spring_integration_support">
<title>Native Spring Integration Support</title>
<simpara>Because Spring Cloud Stream is based on Spring Integration, Stream completely inherits Integration&#8217;s foundation and infrastructure as well as the component itself.
For example, you can attach the  output channel of a <literal>Source</literal> to a <literal>MessageSource</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Source.class)
public class TimerSource {

  @Value("${format}")
  private String format;

  @InboundChannelAdapter(value = Source.OUTPUT, poller = @Poller(fixedDelay = "${fixedDelay}", maxMessagesPerPoll = "1"))
  public MessageSource&lt;String&gt; timerMessageSource() {
    return () -&gt; new GenericMessage&lt;&gt;(new SimpleDateFormat(format).format(new Date()));
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Or you can use a processor&#8217;s channels in a transformer:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
public class TransformProcessor {
  @Transformer(inputChannel = Processor.INPUT, outputChannel = Processor.OUTPUT)
  public Object transform(String message) {
    return message.toUpperCase();
  }
}</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>It&#8217;s important to understant that when you consume from the same binding using <literal>@StreamListener</literal> a pubsub model is used, where each method annotated with <literal>@StreamListener</literal> receives it&#8217;s own copy of the message, each one has its own consumer group.
However, if you share a bindable channel as an input for <literal>@Aggregator</literal>, <literal>@Transformer</literal> or <literal>@ServiceActivator</literal>, those will consume in a competing model, no individual consumer group is created for each subscription.</simpara>

</section>
<section xml:id="_spring_integration_error_channel_support">
<title>Spring Integration Error Channel Support</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream supports publishing error messages received by the Spring Integration global
error channel. Error messages sent to the <literal>errorChannel</literal> can be published to a specific destination
at the broker by configuring a binding for the outbound target named <literal>error</literal>. For example, to
publish error messages to a broker destination named "myErrors", provide the following property:
<literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.error.destination=myErrors</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="binder-error-channels">
<title>Message Channel Binders and Error Channels</title>
<simpara>Starting with <emphasis>version 1.3</emphasis>, some <literal>MessageChannel</literal> - based binders publish errors to a discrete error channel for each destination.
In addition, these error channels are bridged to the global Spring Integration <literal>errorChannel</literal> mentioned above.
You can therefore consume errors for specific destinations and/or for all destinations, using a standard Spring Integration flow (<literal>IntegrationFlow</literal>, <literal>@ServiceActivator</literal>, etc).</simpara>
<simpara>On the consumer side, the listener thread catches any exceptions and forwards an <literal>ErrorMessage</literal> to the destination&#8217;s error channel.
The payload of the message is a <literal>MessagingException</literal> with the normal <literal>failedMessage</literal> and <literal>cause</literal> properties.
Usually, the raw data received from the broker is included in a header.
For binders that support (and are configured with) a dead letter destination; a <literal>MessagePublishingErrorHandler</literal> is subscribed to the channel, and the raw data is forwarded to the dead letter destination.</simpara>
<simpara>On the producer side; for binders that support some kind of async result after publishing messages (e.g. RabbitMQ, Kafka), you can enable an error channel by setting the <literal>&#8230;&#8203;producer.errorChannelEnabled</literal> to <literal>true</literal>.
The payload of the <literal>ErrorMessage</literal> depends on the binder implementation but will be a <literal>MessagingException</literal> with the normal <literal>failedMessage</literal>  property, as well as additional properties about the failure.
Refer to the binder documentation for complete details.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_using_streamlistener_for_automatic_content_type_handling">
<title>Using @StreamListener for Automatic Content Type Handling</title>
<simpara>Complementary to its Spring Integration support, Spring Cloud Stream provides its own <literal>@StreamListener</literal> annotation, modeled after other Spring Messaging annotations (e.g. <literal>@MessageMapping</literal>, <literal>@JmsListener</literal>, <literal>@RabbitListener</literal>, etc.).
The <literal>@StreamListener</literal> annotation provides a simpler model for handling inbound messages, especially when dealing with use cases that involve content type management and type coercion.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides an extensible <literal>MessageConverter</literal> mechanism for handling data conversion by bound channels and for, in this case, dispatching to methods annotated with <literal>@StreamListener</literal>.
The following is an example of an application which processes external <literal>Vote</literal> events:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public class VoteHandler {

  @Autowired
  VotingService votingService;

  @StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)
  public void handle(Vote vote) {
    votingService.record(vote);
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The distinction between <literal>@StreamListener</literal> and a Spring Integration <literal>@ServiceActivator</literal> is seen when considering an inbound <literal>Message</literal> that has a <literal>String</literal> payload and a <literal>contentType</literal> header of <literal>application/json</literal>.
In the case of <literal>@StreamListener</literal>, the <literal>MessageConverter</literal> mechanism will use the <literal>contentType</literal> header to parse the <literal>String</literal> payload into a <literal>Vote</literal> object.</simpara>
<simpara>As with other Spring Messaging methods, method arguments can be annotated with <literal>@Payload</literal>, <literal>@Headers</literal> and <literal>@Header</literal>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>For methods which return data, you must use the <literal>@SendTo</literal> annotation to specify the output binding destination for data returned by the method:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Processor.class)

<title>Using @StreamListener for dispatching messages to multiple methods</title>
<simpara>Since version 1.2, Spring Cloud Stream supports dispatching messages to multiple <literal>@StreamListener</literal> methods registered on an input channel, based on a condition.</simpara>
<simpara>In order to be eligible to support conditional dispatching, a method must satisfy the follow conditions:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>it must not return a value</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>it must be an individual message handling method (reactive API methods are not supported)</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The condition is specified via a SpEL expression in the <literal>condition</literal> attribute of the annotation and is evaluated for each message.
All the handlers that match the condition will be invoked in the same thread and no assumption must be made about the order in which the invocations take place.</simpara>
<simpara>An example of using <literal>@StreamListener</literal> with dispatching conditions can be seen below.
In this example, all the messages bearing a header <literal>type</literal> with the value <literal>foo</literal> will be dispatched to the <literal>receiveFoo</literal> method, and all the messages bearing a header <literal>type</literal> with the value <literal>bar</literal> will be dispatched to the <literal>receiveBar</literal> method.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class TestPojoWithAnnotatedArguments {

    @StreamListener(target = Sink.INPUT, condition = "headers['type']=='foo'")
    public void receiveFoo(@Payload FooPojo fooPojo) {
       // handle the message
    }

    @StreamListener(target = Sink.INPUT, condition = "headers['type']=='bar'")
    public void receiveBar(@Payload BarPojo barPojo) {
       // handle the message
    }
}</programlisting>

<simpara>Dispatching via <literal>@StreamListener</literal> conditions is only supported for handlers of individual messages, and not for reactive programming support (described below).</simpara>

<title>Reactive Programming Support</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream also supports the use of reactive APIs where incoming and outgoing data is handled as continuous data flows.
Support for reactive APIs is available via the <literal>spring-cloud-stream-reactive</literal>, which needs to be added explicitly to your project.</simpara>
<simpara>The programming model with reactive APIs is declarative, where instead of specifying how each individual message should be handled, you can use operators that describe functional transformations from inbound to outbound data flows.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream supports the following reactive APIs:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Reactor</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>RxJava 1.x</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>In the future, it is intended to support a more generic model based on Reactive Streams.</simpara>
<simpara>The reactive programming model is also using the <literal>@StreamListener</literal> annotation for setting up reactive handlers. The differences are that:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>the <literal>@StreamListener</literal> annotation must not specify an input or output, as they are provided as arguments and return values from the method;</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>the arguments of the method must be annotated with <literal>@Input</literal> and <literal>@Output</literal> indicating which input or output will the incoming and respectively outgoing data flows connect to;</simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara>the return value of the method, if any, will be annotated with <literal>@Output</literal>, indicating the input where data shall be sent.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<note>
<simpara>Reactive programming support requires Java 1.8.</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>As of Spring Cloud Stream 1.1.1 and later (starting with release train Brooklyn.SR2), reactive programming support requires the use of Reactor 3.0.4.RELEASE and higher.
Earlier Reactor versions (including 3.0.1.RELEASE, 3.0.2.RELEASE and 3.0.3.RELEASE) are not supported.
<literal>spring-cloud-stream-reactive</literal> will transitively retrieve the proper version, but it is possible for the project structure to manage the version of the <literal>io.projectreactor:reactor-core</literal> to an earlier release, especially when using Maven.
This is the case for projects generated via Spring Initializr with Spring Boot 1.x, which will override the Reactor version to <literal>2.0.8.RELEASE</literal>.
In such cases you must ensure that the proper version of the artifact is released.
This can be simply achieved by adding a direct dependency on <literal>io.projectreactor:reactor-core</literal> with a version of <literal>3.0.4.RELEASE</literal> or later to your project.</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>The use of term <literal>reactive</literal> is currently referring to the reactive APIs being used and not to the execution model being reactive (i.e. the bound endpoints are still using a 'push' rather than 'pull' model). While some backpressure support is provided by the use of Reactor, we do intend on the long run to support entirely reactive pipelines by the use of native reactive clients for the connected middleware.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_reactor_based_handlers">
<title>Reactor-based handlers</title>
<simpara>A Reactor based handler can have the following argument types:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>For arguments annotated with <literal>@Input</literal>, it supports the  Reactor type <literal>Flux</literal>.
The parameterization of the inbound Flux follows the same rules as in the case of individual message handling: it can be the entire <literal>Message</literal>, a POJO which can be the <literal>Message</literal> payload, or a POJO which is the result of a transformation based on the <literal>Message</literal> content-type header. Multiple inputs are provided;</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>For arguments annotated with <literal>Output</literal>, it supports the type <literal>FluxSender</literal> which connects a <literal>Flux</literal> produced by the method with an output. Generally speaking, specifying outputs as arguments is only recommended when the method can have multiple outputs;</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>A Reactor based handler supports a return type of <literal>Flux</literal>, case in which it must be annotated with <literal>@Output</literal>. We recommend using the return value of the method when a single output flux is available.</simpara>
<simpara>Here is an example of a simple Reactor-based Processor.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class UppercaseTransformer {

  @StreamListener
  @Output(Processor.OUTPUT)
  public Flux&lt;String&gt; receive(@Input(Processor.INPUT) Flux&lt;String&gt; input) {
    return input.map(s -&gt; s.toUpperCase());
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The same processor using output arguments looks like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class UppercaseTransformer {

  @StreamListener
  public void receive(@Input(Processor.INPUT) Flux&lt;String&gt; input,

     output.send(input.map(s -&gt; s.toUpperCase()));
  }
}</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_rxjava_1_x_support">
<title>RxJava 1.x support</title>
<simpara>RxJava 1.x handlers follow the same rules as Reactor-based one, but will use <literal>Observable</literal> and <literal>ObservableSender</literal> arguments and return types.</simpara>
<simpara>So the first example above will become:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class UppercaseTransformer {

  @StreamListener
  @Output(Processor.OUTPUT)
  public Observable&lt;String&gt; receive(@Input(Processor.INPUT) Observable&lt;String&gt; input) {

  }
}</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_reactive_sources">
<title>Reactive Sources</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream reactive support also provides the ability for creating reactive sources through the StreamEmitter annotation.
Using StreamEmitter annotation, a regular source may be converted to a reactive one.
StreamEmitter is a method level annotation that marks a method to be an emitter to outputs declared via EnableBinding.
It is not allowed to use the Input annotation along with StreamEmitter, as the methods marked with this annotation are not listening from any input, rather generating to an output.
Following the same programming model used in StreamListener, StreamEmitter also allows flexible ways of using the Output annotation depending on whether the method has any arguments, return type etc.</simpara>
<simpara>Here are some examples of using StreamEmitter in various styles.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example will emit the "Hello World" message every millisecond and publish to a Flux.
In this case, the resulting messages in Flux will be sent to the output channel of the Source.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Source.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class HelloWorldEmitter {

  @StreamEmitter
  @Output(Source.OUTPUT)
  public Flux&lt;String&gt; emit() {
    return Flux.intervalMillis(1)
            .map(l -&gt; "Hello World");
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Following is another flavor of the same sample as above.
Instead of returning a Flux, this method uses a FluxSender to programmatically send Flux from a source.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Source.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class HelloWorldEmitter {

  @StreamEmitter
  @Output(Source.OUTPUT)
  public void emit(FluxSender output) {
    output.send(Flux.intervalMillis(1)
            .map(l -&gt; "Hello World"));
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Following is exactly same as the above snippet in functionality and style.
However, instead of using an explicit Output annotation at the method level, it is used as the method parameter level.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Source.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class HelloWorldEmitter {

  @StreamEmitter
  public void emit(@Output(Source.OUTPUT) FluxSender output) {
    output.send(Flux.intervalMillis(1)
            .map(l -&gt; "Hello World"));
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Here is yet another flavor of writing reacting sources using the Reactive Streams Publisher API and the support for it in the <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration-java-dsl/wiki/Spring-Integration-Java-DSL-Reference">Spring Integration Java DSL</link>.
The Publisher is still using Reactor Flux under the hood, but from an application perspective, that is transparent to the user and only needs Reactive Streams and Java DSL for Spring Integration.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Source.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class HelloWorldEmitter {

  @StreamEmitter
  @Output(Source.OUTPUT)
  @Bean
  public Publisher&lt;Message&lt;String&gt;&gt; emit() {
    return IntegrationFlows.from(() -&gt;
                new GenericMessage&lt;&gt;("Hello World"),
        e -&gt; e.poller(p -&gt; p.fixedDelay(1)))
        .toReactivePublisher();
  }
}</programlisting>

<section xml:id="_aggregation">
<title>Aggregation</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides support for aggregating multiple applications together, connecting their input and output channels directly and avoiding the additional cost of exchanging messages via a broker.
As of version 1.0 of Spring Cloud Stream, aggregation is supported only for the following types of applications:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis>sources</emphasis> - applications with a single output channel named <literal>output</literal>, typically having a single binding of the type <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.messaging.Source</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis>sinks</emphasis> - applications with a single input channel named <literal>input</literal>, typically having a single binding of the type <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.messaging.Sink</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis>processors</emphasis> - applications with a single input channel named <literal>input</literal> and a single output channel named <literal>output</literal>, typically having a single binding of the type <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.messaging.Processor</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>They can be aggregated together by creating a sequence of interconnected applications, in which the output channel of an element in the sequence is connected to the input channel of the next element, if it exists.
A sequence can start with either a <emphasis>source</emphasis> or a <emphasis>processor</emphasis>, it can contain an arbitrary number of <emphasis>processors</emphasis> and must end with either a <emphasis>processor</emphasis> or a <emphasis>sink</emphasis>.</simpara>
<simpara>Depending on the nature of the starting and ending element, the sequence may have one or more bindable channels, as follows:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>if the sequence starts with a source and ends with a sink, all communication between the applications is direct and no channels will be bound</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>if the sequence starts with a processor, then its input channel will become the <literal>input</literal> channel of the aggregate and will be bound accordingly</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>if the sequence ends with a processor, then its output channel will become the <literal>output</literal> channel of the aggregate and will be bound accordingly</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Aggregation is performed using the <literal>AggregateApplicationBuilder</literal> utility class, as in the following example.
Let&#8217;s consider a project in which we have source, processor and a sink, which may be defined in the project, or may be contained in one of the project&#8217;s dependencies.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Each component (source, sink or processor) in an aggregate application must be provided in a separate package if the configuration classes use <literal>@SpringBootApplication</literal>.
This is required to avoid cross-talk between applications, due to the classpath scanning performed by <literal>@SpringBootApplication</literal> on the configuration classes inside the same package.
In the example below, it can be seen that the Source, Processor and Sink application classes are grouped in separate packages.
A possible alternative is to provide the source, sink or processor configuration in a separate <literal>@Configuration</literal> class, avoid the use of <literal>@SpringBootApplication</literal>/<literal>@ComponentScan</literal> and use those for aggregation.</simpara>

<simpara>A <emphasis>producer</emphasis> is any component that sends messages to a channel.
The channel can be bound to an external message broker via a Binder implementation for that broker.
When invoking the <literal>bindProducer()</literal> method, the first parameter is the name of the destination within the broker, the second parameter is the local channel instance to which the producer will send messages, and the third parameter contains properties (such as a partition key expression) to be used within the adapter that is created for that channel.</simpara>
<simpara>A <emphasis>consumer</emphasis> is any component that receives messages from a channel.
As with a producer, the consumer&#8217;s channel can be bound to an external message broker.
When invoking the <literal>bindConsumer()</literal> method, the first parameter is the destination name, and a second parameter provides the name of a logical group of consumers.
Each group that is represented by consumer bindings for a given destination receives a copy of each message that a producer sends to that destination (i.e., publish-subscribe semantics).
If there are multiple consumer instances bound using the same group name, then messages will be load-balanced across those consumer instances so that each message sent by a producer is consumed by only a single consumer instance within each group (i.e., queueing semantics).</simpara>

<section xml:id="_binder_spi">
<title>Binder SPI</title>
<simpara>The Binder SPI consists of a number of interfaces, out-of-the box utility classes and discovery strategies that provide a pluggable mechanism for connecting to external middleware.</simpara>

<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream relies on implementations of the Binder SPI to perform the task of connecting channels to message brokers.
Each Binder implementation typically connects to one type of messaging system.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_classpath_detection">
<title>Classpath Detection</title>
<simpara>By default, Spring Cloud Stream relies on Spring Boot&#8217;s auto-configuration to configure the binding process.
If a single Binder implementation is found on the classpath, Spring Cloud Stream will use it automatically.
For example, a Spring Cloud Stream project that aims to bind only to RabbitMQ can simply add the following dependency:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit&lt;/artifactId&gt;

</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="multiple-binders">
<title>Multiple Binders on the Classpath</title>
<simpara>When multiple binders are present on the classpath, the application must indicate which binder is to be used for each channel binding.
Each binder configuration contains a <literal>META-INF/spring.binders</literal>, which is a simple properties file:</simpara>
<screen>rabbit:\
org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.rabbit.config.RabbitServiceAutoConfiguration</screen>
<simpara>Similar files exist for the other provided binder implementations (e.g., Kafka), and custom binder implementations are expected to provide them, as well.
The key represents an identifying name for the binder implementation, whereas the value is a comma-separated list of configuration classes that each contain one and only one bean definition of type <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.Binder</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Binder selection can either be performed globally, using the <literal>spring.cloud.stream.defaultBinder</literal> property (e.g., <literal>spring.cloud.stream.defaultBinder=rabbit</literal>) or individually, by configuring the binder on each channel binding.
For instance, a processor application (that has channels with the names <literal>input</literal> and <literal>output</literal> for read/write respectively) which reads from Kafka and writes to RabbitMQ can specify the following configuration:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.binder=kafka
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.binder=rabbit</screen>
</section>
<section xml:id="multiple-systems">
<title>Connecting to Multiple Systems</title>
<simpara>By default, binders share the application&#8217;s Spring Boot auto-configuration, so that one instance of each binder found on the classpath will be created.
If your application should connect to more than one broker of the same type, you can specify multiple binder configurations, each with different environment settings.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Turning on explicit binder configuration will disable the default binder configuration process altogether.
If you do this, all binders in use must be included in the configuration.
Frameworks that intend to use Spring Cloud Stream transparently may create binder configurations that can be referenced by name, but will not affect the default binder configuration.
In order to do so, a binder configuration may have its <literal>defaultCandidate</literal> flag set to false, e.g. <literal>spring.cloud.stream.binders.&lt;configurationName&gt;.defaultCandidate=false</literal>.
This denotes a configuration that will exist independently of the default binder configuration process.</simpara>

<section xml:id="dynamicdestination">
<title>Using dynamically bound destinations</title>
<simpara>Besides the channels defined via <literal>@EnableBinding</literal>, Spring Cloud Stream allows applications to send messages to dynamically bound destinations.
This is useful, for example, when the target destination needs to be determined at runtime.
Applications can do so by using the <literal>BinderAwareChannelResolver</literal> bean, registered automatically by the <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> annotation.</simpara>
<simpara>The property 'spring.cloud.stream.dynamicDestinations' can be used for restricting the dynamic destination names to a set known beforehand (whitelisting).
If the property is not set, any destination can be bound dynamicaly.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>BinderAwareChannelResolver</literal> can be used directly as in the following example, in which a REST controller uses a path variable to decide the target channel.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding
@Controller
public class SourceWithDynamicDestination {

	@Autowired
	private BinderAwareChannelResolver resolver;

	@RequestMapping(path = "/{target}", method = POST, consumes = "*/*")
	@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.ACCEPTED)
	public void handleRequest(@RequestBody String body, @PathVariable("target") target,
	       @RequestHeader(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE) Object contentType) {
		sendMessage(body, target, contentType);
	}

	private void sendMessage(String body, String target, Object contentType) {
		resolver.resolveDestination(target).send(MessageBuilder.createMessage(body,
				new MessageHeaders(Collections.singletonMap(MessageHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE, contentType))));
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>After starting the application on the default port 8080, when sending the following data:</simpara>
<screen>curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d "customer-1" http://localhost:8080/customers

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d "order-1" http://localhost:8080/orders</screen>
<simpara>The destinations 'customers' and 'orders' are created in the broker (for example: exchange in case of Rabbit or topic in case of Kafka) with the names 'customers' and 'orders', and the data is published to the appropriate destinations.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>BinderAwareChannelResolver</literal> is a general purpose Spring Integration <literal>DestinationResolver</literal> and can be injected in other components.
For example, in a router using a SpEL expression based on the <literal>target</literal> field of an incoming JSON message.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding
@Controller
public class SourceWithDynamicDestination {

	@Autowired
	private BinderAwareChannelResolver resolver;


	@RequestMapping(path = "/", method = POST, consumes = "application/json")
	@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.ACCEPTED)
	public void handleRequest(@RequestBody String body, @RequestHeader(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE) Object contentType) {
		sendMessage(body, contentType);
	}

	private void sendMessage(Object body, Object contentType) {
		routerChannel().send(MessageBuilder.createMessage(body,
				new MessageHeaders(Collections.singletonMap(MessageHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE, contentType))));
	}

	@Bean(name = "routerChannel")
	public MessageChannel routerChannel() {

<chapter xml:id="contenttypemanagement">
<title>Content Type and Transformation</title>
<simpara>To allow you to propagate information about the content type of produced messages, Spring Cloud Stream attaches, by default, a <literal>contentType</literal> header to outbound messages.
For middleware that does not directly support headers, Spring Cloud Stream provides its own mechanism of automatically wrapping outbound messages in an envelope of its own.
For middleware that does support headers, Spring Cloud Stream applications may receive messages with a given content type from non-Spring Cloud Stream applications.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream can handle messages based on this information in two ways:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Through its <literal>contentType</literal> settings on inbound and outbound channels</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Through its argument mapping performed for methods annotated with <literal>@StreamListener</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream allows you to declaratively configure type conversion for inputs and outputs using the <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.&lt;channelName&gt;.content-type</literal> property of a binding.
Note that general type conversion may also be accomplished easily by using a transformer inside your application.
Currently, Spring Cloud Stream natively supports the following type conversions commonly used in streams:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">JSON</emphasis> to/from <emphasis role="strong">POJO</emphasis></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">JSON</emphasis> to/from <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-tuple/blob/master/spring-tuple/src/main/java/org/springframework/tuple/Tuple.java">org.springframework.tuple.Tuple</link></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Object</emphasis> to/from <emphasis role="strong">byte[]</emphasis> : Either the raw bytes serialized for remote transport, bytes emitted by an application, or converted to bytes using Java serialization(requires the object to be Serializable)</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">String</emphasis> to/from <emphasis role="strong">byte[]</emphasis></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Object</emphasis> to <emphasis role="strong">plain text</emphasis> (invokes the object&#8217;s <emphasis>toString()</emphasis> method)</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Where <emphasis>JSON</emphasis> represents either a byte array or String payload containing JSON.
Currently, Objects may be converted from a JSON byte array or String.
Converting to JSON always produces a String.</simpara>
<simpara>If no <literal>content-type</literal> property is set on an outbound channel, Spring Cloud Stream will serialize the payload using a serializer based on the <link xl:href="https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo">Kryo</link> serialization framework.
Deserializing messages at the destination requires the payload class to be present on the receiver&#8217;s classpath.</simpara>
<section xml:id="mime-types">
<title>MIME types</title>
<simpara><literal>content-type</literal> values are parsed as media types, e.g., <literal>application/json</literal> or <literal>text/plain;charset=UTF-8</literal>.
MIME types are especially useful for indicating how to convert to String or byte[] content.
Spring Cloud Stream also uses MIME type format to represent Java types, using the general type <literal>application/x-java-object</literal> with a <literal>type</literal> parameter.
For example, <literal>application/x-java-object;type=java.util.Map</literal> or <literal>application/x-java-object;type=com.bar.Foo</literal> can be set as the <literal>content-type</literal> property of an input binding.
In addition, Spring Cloud Stream provides custom MIME types, notably, <literal>application/x-spring-tuple</literal> to specify a Tuple.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="mime-types-and-java-types">
<title>MIME types and Java types</title>
<simpara>The type conversions Spring Cloud Stream provides out of the box are summarized in the following table:
'Source Payload' means the payload before conversion and 'Target Payload' means the 'payload' after conversion.
The type conversion can occur either on the 'producer' side (output) or at the 'consumer' side (input).</simpara>

For example, if an application produces an XML string with outputType=application/json, the payload will not be converted from XML to JSON.
This is because the payload send to the outbound channel is already a String so no conversion will be applied at runtime.
It is also important to note that when using the default serialization mechanism, the payload class must be shared between the sending and receiving application, and compatible with the binary content.
This can create issues when application code changes independently in the two applications, as the binary format and code may become incompatible.</simpara>
</note>
<tip>
<simpara>While conversion is supported for both inbound and outbound channels, it is especially recommended to be used for the conversion of outbound messages.
For the conversion of inbound messages, especially when the target is a POJO, the <literal>@StreamListener</literal> support will perform the conversion automatically.</simpara>

<title>Customizing message conversion</title>
<simpara>Besides the conversions that it supports out of the box, Spring Cloud Stream also supports registering your own message conversion implementations.
This allows you to send and receive data in a variety of custom formats, including binary, and associate them with specific <literal>contentTypes</literal>.
Spring Cloud Stream registers all the beans of type <literal>org.springframework.messaging.converter.MessageConverter</literal> as custom message converters along with the out of the box message converters.</simpara>
<simpara>If your message converter needs to work with a specific <literal>content-type</literal> and target class (for both input and output), then the message converter needs to extend <literal>org.springframework.messaging.converter.AbstractMessageConverter</literal>.
For conversion when using <literal>@StreamListener</literal>, a message converter that implements <literal>org.springframework.messaging.converter.MessageConverter</literal> would suffice.</simpara>
<simpara>Here is an example of creating a message converter bean (with the content-type <literal>application/bar</literal>) inside a Spring Cloud Stream application:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
@SpringBootApplication
public static class SinkApplication {

  ...

  @Bean
  public MessageConverter customMessageConverter() {
    return new MyCustomMessageConverter();
  }</programlisting>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public class MyCustomMessageConverter extends AbstractMessageConverter {

	public MyCustomMessageConverter() {
		super(new MimeType("application", "bar"));
	}

	@Override
  protected boolean supports(Class&lt;?&gt; clazz) {
    return (Bar.class == clazz);
  }

	@Override
	protected Object convertFromInternal(Message&lt;?&gt; message, Class&lt;?&gt; targetClass, Object conversionHint) {
		Object payload = message.getPayload();
		return (payload instanceof Bar ? payload : new Bar((byte[]) payload));
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream also provides support for Avro-based converters and schema evolution.
See <link linkend="schema-evolution">the specific section</link> for details.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="__literal_streamlistener_literal_and_message_conversion">
<title><literal>@StreamListener</literal> and Message Conversion</title>
<simpara>The <literal>@StreamListener</literal> annotation provides a convenient way for converting incoming messages without the need to specify the content type of an input channel.
During the dispatching process to methods annotated with <literal>@StreamListener</literal>, a conversion will be applied automatically if the argument requires it.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, let&#8217;s consider a message with the String content <literal>{"greeting":"Hello, world"}</literal> and a <literal>content-type</literal> header of <literal>application/json</literal> is received on the input channel.
Let us consider the following application that receives it:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public class GreetingMessage {

  String greeting;

  public String getGreeting() {
    return greeting;
  }

  public void setGreeting(String greeting) {

@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class GreetingSink {

		@StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)

<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides support for schema-based message converters through its <literal>spring-cloud-stream-schema</literal> module.
Currently, the only serialization format supported out of the box for schema-based message converters is Apache Avro, with more formats to be added in future versions.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_apache_avro_message_converters">
<title>Apache Avro Message Converters</title>
<simpara>The <literal>spring-cloud-stream-schema</literal> module contains two types of message converters that can be used for Apache Avro serialization:</simpara>

<simpara>converters using the class information of the serialized/deserialized objects, or a schema with a location known at startup;</simpara>
</listitem>

<section xml:id="_converters_with_schema_support">
<title>Converters with schema support</title>
<simpara>The <literal>AvroSchemaMessageConverter</literal> supports serializing and deserializing messages either using a predefined schema or by using the schema information available in the class (either reflectively, or contained in the <literal>SpecificRecord</literal>).
If the target type of the conversion is a <literal>GenericRecord</literal>, then a schema must be set.</simpara>
<simpara>For using it, you can simply add it to the application context, optionally specifying one ore more <literal>MimeTypes</literal> to associate it with.
The default <literal>MimeType</literal> is <literal>application/avro</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Here is an example of configuring it in a sink application registering the Apache Avro <literal>MessageConverter</literal>, without a predefined schema:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@EnableBinding(Sink.class)

  public MessageConverter userMessageConverter() {
      return new AvroSchemaMessageConverter(MimeType.valueOf("avro/bytes"));

<simpara>In order to understand the schema registry client converter, we will describe the schema registry support first.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_schema_registry_support">
<title>Schema Registry Support</title>
<simpara>Most serialization models, especially the ones that aim for portability across different platforms and languages, rely on a schema that describes how the data is serialized in the binary payload.
In order to serialize the data and then to interpret it, both the sending and receiving sides must have access to a schema that describes the binary format.
In certain cases, the schema can be inferred from the payload type on serialization, or from the target type on deserialization, but in a lot of cases applications benefit from having access to an explicit schema that describes the binary data format.
A schema registry allows you to store schema information in a textual format (typically JSON) and makes that information accessible to various applications that need it to receive and send data in binary format.
A schema is referenceable as a tuple consisting of:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>a <emphasis>subject</emphasis> that is the logical name of the schema;</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<title>Schema Registry Server</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides a schema registry server implementation.
In order to use it, you can simply add the <literal>spring-cloud-stream-schema-server</literal> artifact to your project and use the <literal>@EnableSchemaRegistryServer</literal> annotation, adding the schema registry server REST controller to your application.
This annotation is intended to be used with Spring Boot web applications, and the listening port of the server is controlled by the <literal>server.port</literal> setting.
The <literal>spring.cloud.stream.schema.server.path</literal> setting can be used to control the root path of the schema server (especially when it is embedded in other applications).
The <literal>spring.cloud.stream.schema.server.allowSchemaDeletion</literal> boolean setting enables the deletion of schema. By default this is disabled.</simpara>
<simpara>The schema registry server uses a relational database to store the schemas.
 By default, it uses an embedded database.
You can customize the schema storage using the <link xl:href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-sql">Spring Boot SQL database and JDBC configuration options</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>A Spring Boot application enabling the schema registry looks as follows:</simpara>

<title>Avro Schema Registry Client Message Converters</title>
<simpara>For Spring Boot applications that have a <literal>SchemaRegistryClient</literal> bean registered with the application context, Spring Cloud Stream will auto-configure an Apache Avro message converter that uses the schema registry client for schema management.
This eases schema evolution, as applications that receive messages can get easy access to a writer schema that can be reconciled with their own reader schema.</simpara>
<simpara>For outbound messages, the <literal>MessageConverter</literal> will be activated if the content type of the channel is set to <literal>application/*+avro</literal>, e.g.:</simpara>
<programlisting language="properties" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.contentType=application/*+avro</programlisting>
<simpara>During the outbound conversion, the message converter will try to infer the schemas of the outbound messages based on their type and register them to a subject based on the payload type using the <literal>SchemaRegistryClient</literal>.
If an identical schema is already found, then a reference to it will be retrieved.
If not, the schema will be registered and a new version number will be provided.
The message will be sent with a <literal>contentType</literal> header using the scheme <literal>application/[prefix].[subject].v[version]+avro</literal>, where <literal>prefix</literal> is configurable and <literal>subject</literal> is deduced from the payload type.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, a message of the type <literal>User</literal> may be sent as a binary payload with a content type of <literal>application/vnd.user.v2+avro</literal>, where <literal>user</literal> is the subject and <literal>2</literal> is the version number.</simpara>

<title>Schema Registration and Resolution</title>
<simpara>To better understand how Spring Cloud Stream registers and resolves new schemas, as well as its use of Avro schema comparison features, we will provide two separate subsections below: one for the registration, and one for the resolution of schemas.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_schema_registration_process_serialization">
<title>Schema Registration Process (Serialization)</title>
<simpara>The first part of the registration process is extracting a schema from the payload that is being sent over a channel.
Avro types such as <literal>SpecificRecord</literal> or <literal>GenericRecord</literal> already contain a schema, which can be retrieved immediately from the instance.
In the case of POJOs a schema will be inferred if the property <literal>spring.cloud.stream.schema.avro.dynamicSchemaGenerationEnabled</literal> is set to <literal>true</literal> (the default).</simpara>

<textobject><phrase>schema resolution</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>Once a schema is obtained, the converter will then load its metadata (version) from the remote server.
First it queries a local cache, and if not found it then submits the data to the server that will reply with versioning information.
The converter will always cache the results to avoid the overhead of querying the Schema Server for every new message that needs to be serialized.</simpara>

<simpara>With the schema version information, the converter sets the <literal>contentType</literal> header of the message to carry the version information such as <literal>application/vnd.user.v1+avro</literal></simpara>

<section xml:id="_schema_resolution_process_deserialization">
<title>Schema Resolution Process (Deserialization)</title>
<simpara>When reading messages that contain version information (i.e. a <literal>contentType</literal> header with a scheme like above), the converter will query the Schema server to fetch the <emphasis role="strong">writer</emphasis> schema of the message.

<note>
<simpara>It&#8217;s important to understand the difference between a writer schema (the application that wrote the message) and a reader schema (the receiving application).
Please take a moment to read <link xl:href="https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.7.6/spec.html">the Avro terminology</link> and understand the process.
Spring Cloud Stream will always fetch the writer schema to determine how to read a message. If you want to get Avro&#8217;s schema evolution support working you need to make sure that a readerSchema was properly set for your application.</simpara>

<title>Inter-Application Communication</title>
<section xml:id="_connecting_multiple_application_instances">
<title>Connecting Multiple Application Instances</title>
<simpara>While Spring Cloud Stream makes it easy for individual Spring Boot applications to connect to messaging systems, the typical scenario for Spring Cloud Stream is the creation of multi-application pipelines, where microservice applications send data to each other.
You can achieve this scenario by correlating the input and output destinations of adjacent applications.</simpara>
<simpara>Supposing that a design calls for the Time Source application to send data to the Log Sink application, you can use a common destination named <literal>ticktock</literal> for bindings within both applications.</simpara>
<simpara>Time Source (that has the channel name <literal>output</literal>) will set the following property:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.destination=ticktock</screen>
<simpara>Log Sink (that has the channel name <literal>input</literal>) will set the following property:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=ticktock</screen>
</section>
<section xml:id="_instance_index_and_instance_count">
<title>Instance Index and Instance Count</title>
<simpara>When scaling up Spring Cloud Stream applications, each instance can receive information about how many other instances of the same application exist and what its own instance index is.
Spring Cloud Stream does this through the <literal>spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount</literal> and <literal>spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex</literal> properties.
For example, if there are three instances of a HDFS sink application, all three instances will have <literal>spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount</literal> set to <literal>3</literal>, and the individual applications will have <literal>spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex</literal> set to <literal>0</literal>, <literal>1</literal>, and <literal>2</literal>, respectively.</simpara>
<simpara>When Spring Cloud Stream applications are deployed via Spring Cloud Data Flow, these properties are configured automatically; when Spring Cloud Stream applications are launched independently, these properties must be set correctly.
By default, <literal>spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount</literal> is <literal>1</literal>, and <literal>spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex</literal> is <literal>0</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>In a scaled-up scenario, correct configuration of these two properties is important for addressing partitioning behavior (see below) in general, and the two properties are always required by certain binders (e.g., the Kafka binder) in order to ensure that data are split correctly across multiple consumer instances.</simpara>

<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionKeyExpression=payload.id
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionCount=5</screen>
<simpara>Based on the above example configuration, data will be sent to the target partition using the following logic.</simpara>
<simpara>A partition key&#8217;s value is calculated for each message sent to a partitioned output channel based on the <literal>partitionKeyExpression</literal>.
The <literal>partitionKeyExpression</literal> is a SpEL expression which is evaluated against the outbound message for extracting the partitioning key.</simpara>
<simpara>If a SpEL expression is not sufficient for your needs, you can instead calculate the partition key value by setting the property <literal>partitionKeyExtractorClass</literal> to a class which implements the <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.PartitionKeyExtractorStrategy</literal> interface.
While the SpEL expression should usually suffice, more complex cases may use the custom implementation strategy.
In that case, the property 'partitionKeyExtractorClass' can be set as follows:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionKeyExtractorClass=com.example.MyKeyExtractor
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionCount=5</screen>
<simpara>Once the message key is calculated, the partition selection process will determine the target partition as a value between <literal>0</literal> and <literal>partitionCount - 1</literal>.
The default calculation, applicable in most scenarios, is based on the formula <literal>key.hashCode() % partitionCount</literal>.
This can be customized on the binding, either by setting a SpEL expression to be evaluated against the 'key' (via the <literal>partitionSelectorExpression</literal> property) or by setting a <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.PartitionSelectorStrategy</literal> implementation (via the <literal>partitionSelectorClass</literal> property).</simpara>
<simpara>The binding level properties for 'partitionSelectorExpression' and 'partitionSelectorClass' can be specified similar to the way 'partitionKeyExpression' and 'partitionKeyExtractorClass' properties are specified in the above examples.
Additional properties can be configured for more advanced scenarios, as described in the following section.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_spring_managed_custom_literal_partitionkeyextractorclass_literal_implementations">
<title>Spring-managed custom <literal>PartitionKeyExtractorClass</literal> implementations</title>
<simpara>In the example above, a custom strategy such as <literal>MyKeyExtractor</literal> is instantiated by the Spring Cloud Stream directly.
In some cases, it is necessary for such a custom strategy implementation to be created as a Spring bean, for being able to be managed by Spring, so that it can perform dependency injection, property binding, etc.
This can be done by configuring it as a @Bean in the application context and using the fully qualified class name as the bean&#8217;s name, as in the following example.</simpara>
<screen>@Bean(name="com.example.MyKeyExtractor")
public MyKeyExtractor extractor() {
    return new MyKeyExtractor();
}</screen>
<simpara>As a Spring bean, the custom strategy benefits from the full lifecycle of a Spring bean.
For example, if the implementation need access to the application context directly, it can make implement 'ApplicationContextAware'.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_configuring_input_bindings_for_partitioning">
<title>Configuring Input Bindings for Partitioning</title>
<simpara>An input binding (with the channel name <literal>input</literal>) is configured to receive partitioned data by setting its <literal>partitioned</literal> property, as well as the <literal>instanceIndex</literal> and <literal>instanceCount</literal> properties on the application itself, as in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.consumer.partitioned=true
spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex=3
spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount=5</screen>
<simpara>The <literal>instanceCount</literal> value represents the total number of application instances between which the data need to be partitioned, and the <literal>instanceIndex</literal> must be a unique value across the multiple instances, between <literal>0</literal> and <literal>instanceCount - 1</literal>.
The instance index helps each application instance to identify the unique partition (or, in the case of Kafka, the partition set) from which it receives data.
It is important to set both values correctly in order to ensure that all of the data is consumed and that the application instances receive mutually exclusive datasets.</simpara>
<simpara>While a scenario which using multiple instances for partitioned data processing may be complex to set up in a standalone case, Spring Cloud Dataflow can simplify the process significantly by populating both the input and output values correctly as well as relying on the runtime infrastructure to provide information about the instance index and instance count.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_testing">
<title>Testing</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream provides support for testing your microservice applications without connecting to a messaging system.
You can do that by using the <literal>TestSupportBinder</literal> provided by the <literal>spring-cloud-stream-test-support</literal> library, which can be added as a test dependency to the application:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">   &lt;dependency&gt;
       &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
       &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-stream-test-support&lt;/artifactId&gt;
       &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
   &lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>The <literal>TestSupportBinder</literal> uses the Spring Boot autoconfiguration mechanism to supersede the other binders found on the classpath.
Therefore, when adding a binder as a dependency, make sure that the <literal>test</literal> scope is being used.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>The <literal>TestSupportBinder</literal> allows users to interact with the bound channels and inspect what messages are sent and received by the application</simpara>
<simpara>For outbound message channels, the <literal>TestSupportBinder</literal> registers a single subscriber and retains the messages emitted by the application in a <literal>MessageCollector</literal>.
They can be retrieved during tests and have assertions made against them.</simpara>
<simpara>The user can also send messages to inbound message channels, so that the consumer application can consume the messages.
The following example shows how to test both input and output channels on a processor.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment= SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
public class ExampleTest {

  @Autowired
  private Processor processor;

  @Autowired
  private MessageCollector messageCollector;

  @Test
  @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
  public void testWiring() {
    Message&lt;String&gt; message = new GenericMessage&lt;&gt;("hello");
    processor.input().send(message);
    Message&lt;String&gt; received = (Message&lt;String&gt;) messageCollector.forChannel(processor.output()).poll();
    assertThat(received.getPayload(), equalTo("hello world"));
  }


  @SpringBootApplication
  @EnableBinding(Processor.class)
  public static class MyProcessor {

    @Autowired
    private Processor channels;

    @Transformer(inputChannel = Processor.INPUT, outputChannel = Processor.OUTPUT)
    public String transform(String in) {
      return in + " world";
    }
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In the example above, we are creating an application that has an input and an output channel, bound through the <literal>Processor</literal> interface.
The bound interface is injected into the test so we can have access to both channels.
We are sending a message on the input channel and we are using the <literal>MessageCollector</literal> provided by Spring Cloud Stream&#8217;s test support to capture the message has been sent to the output channel as a result.
Once we have received the message, we can validate that the component functions correctly.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_disabling_the_test_binder_autoconfiguration">
<title>Disabling the test binder autoconfiguration</title>
<simpara>The intent behind the test binder superseding all the other binders on the classpath is to make it easy to test your applications without making changes to your production dependencies.
In some cases (e.g. integration tests) it is useful to use the actual production binders instead, and that requires disabling the test binder autoconfiguration.
In order to do so, you can exclude the <literal>org.springframework.cloud.stream.test.binder.TestSupportBinderAutoConfiguration</literal> class using one of the Spring Boot autoconfiguration exclusion mechanisms, as in the following example.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">	@SpringBootApplication(exclude = TestSupportBinderAutoConfiguration.class)

	public static class MyProcessor {

		@Transformer(inputChannel = Processor.INPUT, outputChannel = Processor.OUTPUT)
		public String transform(String in) {
			return in + " world";
		}
	}</programlisting>
<simpara>When autoconfiguration is disabled, the test binder is available on the classpath, and its <literal>defaultCandidate</literal> property is set to <literal>false</literal>, so that it does not interfere with the regular user configuration. It can be referenced under the name <literal>test</literal> e.g.:</simpara>

This module allow operators to collect metrics from stream applications without relying on polling their endpoints.</simpara>
<simpara>The module is activated when you set the destination name for metrics binding, e.g. <literal>spring.cloud.stream.bindings.applicationMetrics.destination=&lt;DESTINATION_NAME&gt;</literal>.
<literal>applicationMetrics</literal> can be configured in a similar fashion to any other producer binding.

<simpara>A detailed overview of the metrics export process can be found in the <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-metrics.html#production-ready-metric-writers">Spring Boot reference documentation</link>.
Spring Cloud Stream provides a metric exporter named <literal>application</literal> that can be configured via regular <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/1.5.x/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/metrics/export/TriggerProperties.java">Spring Boot metrics configuration properties</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>The exporter can be configured either by using the global Spring Boot configuration settings for exporters, or by using exporter-specific properties.
For using the global configuration settings, the properties should be prefixed by <literal>spring.metric.export</literal> (e.g. <literal>spring.metric.export.includes=integration**</literal>).
These configuration options will apply to all exporters (unless they have been configured differently).
Alternatively, if it is intended to use configuration settings that are different from the other exporters (e.g. for restricting the number of metrics published), the Spring Cloud Stream provided metrics exporter can be configured using the prefix <literal>spring.metrics.export.triggers.application</literal> (e.g. <literal>spring.metrics.export.triggers.application.includes=integration**</literal>).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Due to Spring Boot&#8217;s <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config-relaxed-binding">relaxed binding</link> the value of a property being included can be slightly different than the original value.</simpara>
<simpara>As a rule of thumb, the metric exporter will attempt to normalize all the properties in a consistent format using the dot notation (e.g. <literal>JAVA_HOME</literal> becomes <literal>java.home</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>The goal of normalization is to make downstream consumers of those metrics capable of receiving property names consistently, regardless of how they are set on the monitored application (<literal>--spring.application.name</literal> or <literal>SPRING_APPLICATION_NAME</literal> would always yield <literal>spring.application.name</literal>).</simpara>

</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_getting_started">
<title>Getting Started</title>
<simpara>To get started with creating Spring Cloud Stream applications, visit the <link xl:href="https://start.spring.io">Spring Initializr</link> and create a new Maven project named "GreetingSource".
Select Spring Boot {supported-spring-boot-version} in the dropdown.
In the <emphasis>Search for dependencies</emphasis> text box type <literal>Stream Rabbit</literal> or <literal>Stream Kafka</literal> depending on what binder you want to use.</simpara>
<simpara>Next, create a new class, <literal>GreetingSource</literal>, in the same package as the <literal>GreetingSourceApplication</literal> class.
Give it the following code:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">import org.springframework.cloud.stream.annotation.EnableBinding;
import org.springframework.cloud.stream.messaging.Source;
import org.springframework.integration.annotation.InboundChannelAdapter;

@EnableBinding(Source.class)
public class GreetingSource {

    @InboundChannelAdapter(Source.OUTPUT)
    public String greet() {
        return "hello world " + System.currentTimeMillis();
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>@EnableBinding</literal> annotation is what triggers the creation of Spring Integration infrastructure components.
Specifically, it will create a Kafka connection factory, a Kafka outbound channel adapter, and the message channel defined inside the Source interface:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public interface Source {

  String OUTPUT = "output";

  @Output(Source.OUTPUT)
  MessageChannel output();

}</programlisting>
<simpara>The auto-configuration also creates a default poller, so that the <literal>greet()</literal> method will be invoked once per second.
The standard Spring Integration <literal>@InboundChannelAdapter</literal> annotation sends a message to the source&#8217;s output channel, using the return value as the payload of the message.</simpara>
<simpara>To test-drive this setup, run a Kafka message broker.
An easy way to do this is to use a Docker image:</simpara>
<screen># On OS X
$ docker run -p 2181:2181 -p 9092:9092 --env ADVERTISED_HOST=`docker-machine ip \`docker-machine active\`` --env ADVERTISED_PORT=9092 spotify/kafka

# On Linux
$ docker run -p 2181:2181 -p 9092:9092 --env ADVERTISED_HOST=localhost --env ADVERTISED_PORT=9092 spotify/kafka</screen>
<simpara>Build the application:</simpara>
<screen>./mvnw clean package</screen>
<simpara>The consumer application is coded in a similar manner.
Go back to Initializr and create another project, named LoggingSink.
Then create a new class, <literal>LoggingSink</literal>, in the same package as the class <literal>LoggingSinkApplication</literal> and with the following code:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">import org.springframework.cloud.stream.annotation.EnableBinding;
import org.springframework.cloud.stream.annotation.StreamListener;
import org.springframework.cloud.stream.messaging.Sink;

@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public class LoggingSink {

    @StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)
    public void log(String message) {
        System.out.println(message);
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Build the application:</simpara>
<screen>./mvnw clean package</screen>
<simpara>To connect the GreetingSource application to the LoggingSink application, each application must share the same destination name.
Starting up both applications as shown below, you will see the consumer application printing "hello world" and a timestamp to the console:</simpara>
<screen>cd GreetingSource
java -jar target/GreetingSource-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.destination=mydest

cd LoggingSink
java -jar target/LoggingSink-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=8090 --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=mydest</screen>
<simpara>(The different server port prevents collisions of the HTTP port used to service the Spring Boot Actuator endpoints in the two applications.)</simpara>
<simpara>The output of the LoggingSink application will look something like the following:</simpara>
<screen>[           main] s.b.c.e.t.TomcatEmbeddedServletContainer : Tomcat started on port(s): 8090 (http)
[           main] com.example.LoggingSinkApplication       : Started LoggingSinkApplication in 6.828 seconds (JVM running for 7.371)

<simpara>If you use non default versions for Kafka dependencies as advised above, all you have to do is not to include the kafka broker dependency.

On the other hand, if auto topic creation is disabled on the server, then care must be taken before running the application to create the topic with the desired number of partitions.</simpara>
<simpara>If you want to have full control over how partitions are allocated, then leave the default settings as they are, i.e. do not exclude the kafka broker jar and ensure that <literal>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.autoCreateTopics</literal> is set to <literal>true</literal>, which is the default.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_kafka_streams_binding_capabilities_of_spring_cloud_stream">
<title>Kafka Streams Binding Capabilities of Spring Cloud Stream</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream Kafka support also includes a binder specifically designed for Kafka Streams binding.
Using this binder, applications can be written that leverage the Kafka Streams API.
For more information on Kafka Streams, see <link xl:href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/developer-guide">Kafka Streams API Developer Manual</link></simpara>
<simpara>Kafka Streams support in Spring Cloud Stream is based on the foundations provided by the Spring Kafka project. For details on that support, see <link xl:href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/reference/html/_reference.html#kafka-streams">Kafaka Streams Support in Spring Kafka</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>Here are the maven coordinates for the Spring Cloud Stream KStream binder artifact.</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-stream-binder-kstream&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>In addition to leveraging the Spring Cloud Stream programming model which is based on Spring Boot, one of the main other benefits that the KStream binder provides is the fact that it avoids the boilerplate configuration that one needs to write when using the Kafka Streams API directly.
High level streams DSL provided through the Kafka Streams API can be used through Spring Cloud Stream in the current support.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_usage_example_of_high_level_streams_dsl">
<title>Usage example of high level streams DSL</title>

public class WordCountProcessorApplication {

	@StreamListener("input")
	@SendTo("output")

<simpara>If you build it as Spring Boot runnable fat jar, you can run the above example in the following way:</simpara>
<screen>java -jar uber.jar  --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=words --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.destination=counts</screen>
<simpara>This means that the application will listen from the incoming Kafka topic words and write to the output topic counts.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream will ensure that the messages from both the incoming and outgoing topics are bound as KStream objects.
As one may observe, the developer can exclusively focus on the business aspects of the code, i.e. writing the logic required in the processor rather than setting up the streams specific configuration required by the Kafka Streams infrastructure.
All those boilerplate is handled by Spring Cloud Stream behind the scenes.</simpara>

<title>Error Channels</title>
<simpara>Starting with <emphasis>version 1.3</emphasis>, the binder unconditionally sends exceptions to an error channel for each consumer destination, and can be configured to send async producer send failures to an error channel too.
See <xref linkend="binder-error-channels"/> for more information.</simpara>
<simpara>The payload of the <literal>ErrorMessage</literal> for a send failure is a <literal>KafkaSendFailureException</literal> with properties:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>failedMessage</literal> - the spring-messaging <literal>Message&lt;?&gt;</literal> that failed to be sent.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>record</literal> - the raw <literal>ProducerRecord</literal> that was created from the <literal>failedMessage</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>There is no automatic handling of these exceptions (such as sending to a <link linkend="kafka-dlq-processing">Dead-Letter queue</link>); you can consume these exceptions with your own Spring Integration flow.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="kafka-metrics">
<title>Kafka Metrics</title>
<simpara>Kafka binder module exposes the following metrics:</simpara>
<simpara><literal>spring.cloud.stream.binder.kafka.someGroup.someTopic.lag</literal>  - this metric indicates how many messages have not been yet consumed from given binder&#8217;s topic by given consumer group.
For example if the value of the metric <literal>spring.cloud.stream.binder.kafka.myGroup.myTopic.lag</literal> is <literal>1000</literal>, then consumer group <literal>myGroup</literal> has <literal>1000</literal> messages to waiting to be consumed from topic <literal>myTopic</literal>.
This metric is particularly useful to provide auto-scaling feedback to PaaS platform of your choice.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="kafka-dlq-processing">
<title>Dead-Letter Topic Processing</title>
<simpara>Because it can&#8217;t be anticipated how users would want to dispose of dead-lettered messages, the framework does not provide any standard mechanism to handle them.
If the reason for the dead-lettering is transient, you may wish to route the messages back to the original topic.
However, if the problem is a permanent issue, that could cause an infinite loop.
The following <literal>spring-boot</literal> application is an example of how to route those messages back to the original topic, but moves them to a third "parking lot" topic after three attempts.
The application is simply another spring-cloud-stream application that reads from the dead-letter topic.
It terminates when no messages are received for 5 seconds.</simpara>
<simpara>The examples assume the original destination is <literal>so8400out</literal> and the consumer group is <literal>so8400</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>There are several considerations.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Consider only running the rerouting when the main application is not running.
Otherwise, the retries for transient errors will be used up very quickly.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Alternatively, use a two-stage approach - use this application to route to a third topic, and another to route from there back to the main topic.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Since this technique uses a message header to keep track of retries, it won&#8217;t work with <literal>headerMode=raw</literal>.
In that case, consider adding some data to the payload (that can be ignored by the main application).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>x-retries</literal> has to be added to the <literal>headers</literal> property <literal>spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.headers=x-retries</literal> on both this, and the main application so that the header is transported between the applications.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Since kafka is publish/subscribe, replayed messages will be sent to each consumer group, even those that successfully processed a message the first time around.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_usage_2">
<title>Usage</title>
<simpara>For using the RabbitMQ binder, you just need to add it to your Spring Cloud Stream application, using the following Maven coordinates:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Alternatively, you can also use the Spring Cloud Stream RabbitMQ Starter.</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-starter-stream-rabbit&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>

<simpara>The RabbitMQ Binder implementation maps each destination to a <literal>TopicExchange</literal>.
For each consumer group, a <literal>Queue</literal> will be bound to that <literal>TopicExchange</literal>.
Each consumer instance have a corresponding RabbitMQ <literal>Consumer</literal> instance for its group&#8217;s <literal>Queue</literal>.
For partitioned producers/consumers the queues are suffixed with the partition index and use the partition index as routing key.</simpara>
<simpara>Using the <literal>autoBindDlq</literal> option, you can optionally configure the binder to create and configure dead-letter queues (DLQs) (and a dead-letter exchange <literal>DLX</literal>).
The dead letter queue has the name of the destination, appended with <literal>.dlq</literal>.
If retry is enabled (<literal>maxAttempts &gt; 1</literal>) failed messages will be delivered to the DLQ.
If retry is disabled (<literal>maxAttempts = 1</literal>), you should set <literal>requeueRejected</literal> to <literal>false</literal> (default) so that a failed message will be routed to the DLQ, instead of being requeued.
In addition, <literal>republishToDlq</literal> causes the binder to publish a failed message to the DLQ (instead of rejecting it); this enables additional information to be added to the message in headers, such as the stack trace in the <literal>x-exception-stacktrace</literal> header.
This option does not need retry enabled; you can republish a failed message after just one attempt.
Starting with <emphasis>version 1.2</emphasis>, you can configure the delivery mode of republished messages; see property <literal>republishDeliveryMode</literal>.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>Setting <literal>requeueRejected</literal> to <literal>true</literal> will cause the message to be requeued and redelivered continually, which is likely not what you want unless the failure issue is transient.
In general, it&#8217;s better to enable retry within the binder by setting <literal>maxAttempts</literal> to greater than one, or set <literal>republishToDlq</literal> to <literal>true</literal>.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>See <xref linkend="rabbit-binder-properties"/> for more information about these properties.</simpara>
<simpara>The framework does not provide any standard mechanism to consume dead-letter messages (or to re-route them back to the primary queue).
Some options are described in <xref linkend="rabbit-dlq-processing"/>.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>When <emphasis role="strong">multiple</emphasis> RabbitMQ binders are used in a Spring Cloud Stream application, it is important to disable 'RabbitAutoConfiguration' to avoid the same configuration from <literal>RabbitAutoConfiguration</literal> being applied to the two binders.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Starting with <emphasis>version 1.3</emphasis>, the <literal>RabbitMessageChannelBinder</literal> creates an internal <literal>ConnectionFactory</literal> copy for the non-transactional producers to avoid dead locks on consumers when shared, cached connections are blocked because of <link xl:href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/memory.html">Memory Alarm</link> on Broker.</simpara>

<simpara>By default, the RabbitMQ binder uses Spring Boot&#8217;s <literal>ConnectionFactory</literal>, and it therefore supports all Spring Boot configuration options for RabbitMQ.
(For reference, consult the <link xl:href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#common-application-properties">Spring Boot documentation</link>.)

<section xml:id="_retry_with_the_rabbitmq_binder">
<title>Retry With the RabbitMQ Binder</title>
<section xml:id="_overview">
<title>Overview</title>
<simpara>When retry is enabled within the binder, the listener container thread is suspended for any back off periods that are configured.
This might be important when strict ordering is required with a single consumer but for other use cases it prevents other messages from being processed on that thread.
An alternative to using binder retry is to set up dead lettering with time to live on the dead-letter queue (DLQ), as well as dead-letter configuration on the DLQ itself.
See <xref linkend="rabbit-binder-properties"/> for more information about the properties discussed here.
Example configuration to enable this feature:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Set <literal>autoBindDlq</literal> to <literal>true</literal> - the binder will create a DLQ; you can optionally specify a name in <literal>deadLetterQueueName</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Set <literal>dlqTtl</literal> to the back off time you want to wait between redeliveries</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Set the <literal>dlqDeadLetterExchange</literal> to the default exchange - expired messages from the DLQ will be routed to the original queue since the default <literal>deadLetterRoutingKey</literal> is the queue name (<literal>destination.group</literal>)</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>To force a message to be dead-lettered, either throw an <literal>AmqpRejectAndDontRequeueException</literal>, or set <literal>requeueRejected</literal> to <literal>true</literal> and throw any exception.</simpara>
<simpara>The loop will continue without end, which is fine for transient problems but you may want to give up after some number of attempts.
Fortunately, RabbitMQ provides the <literal>x-death</literal> header which allows you to determine how many cycles have occurred.</simpara>
<simpara>To acknowledge a message after giving up, throw an <literal>ImmediateAcknowledgeAmqpException</literal>.</simpara>

<title>Error Channels</title>
<simpara>Starting with <emphasis>version 1.3</emphasis>, the binder unconditionally sends exceptions to an error channel for each consumer destination, and can be configured to send async producer send failures to an error channel too.

<simpara>With rabbitmq, there are two types of send failures:</simpara>

<simpara>The latter is rare; quoting the RabbitMQ documentation "[A nack] will only be delivered if an internal error occurs in the Erlang process responsible for a queue.".</simpara>
<simpara>As well as enabling producer error channels as described in <xref linkend="binder-error-channels"/>, the RabbitMQ binder will only send messages to the channels if the connection factory is appropriately configured:</simpara>

</section>
<section xml:id="rabbit-dlq-processing">
<title>Dead-Letter Queue Processing</title>
<simpara>Because it can&#8217;t be anticipated how users would want to dispose of dead-lettered messages, the framework does not provide any standard mechanism to handle them.
If the reason for the dead-lettering is transient, you may wish to route the messages back to the original queue.
However, if the problem is a permanent issue, that could cause an infinite loop.
The following <literal>spring-boot</literal> application is an example of how to route those messages back to the original queue, but moves them to a third "parking lot" queue after three attempts.
The second example utilizes the <link xl:href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2015/04/16/scheduling-messages-with-rabbitmq/">RabbitMQ Delayed Message Exchange</link> to introduce a delay to the requeued message.
In this example, the delay increases for each attempt.
These examples use a <literal>@RabbitListener</literal> to receive messages from the DLQ, you could also use <literal>RabbitTemplate.receive()</literal> in a batch process.</simpara>
<simpara>The examples assume the original destination is <literal>so8400in</literal> and the consumer group is <literal>so8400</literal>.</simpara>

<title>Spring Cloud Bus</title>
<partintro>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Bus links nodes of a distributed system with a lightweight message broker. This can then be used to broadcast state changes (e.g. configuration changes) or other management instructions. A key idea is that the Bus is like a distributed Actuator for a Spring Boot application that is scaled out, but it can also be used as a communication channel between apps. Starters are provided for an AMQP broker as the transport or for Kafka, but the same basic feature set (and some more depending on the transport) is on the roadmap for other transports.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Spring Cloud is released under the non-restrictive Apache 2.0 license. If you would like to contribute to this section of the documentation or if you find an error, please find the source code and issue trackers in the project at <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config/tree/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc">github</link>.</simpara>
</note>
</partintro>
<chapter xml:id="_quick_start_2">
<title>Quick Start</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Bus works by adding Spring Boot autconfiguration if it detects itself on the classpath. All you need to do to enable the bus is to add <literal>spring-cloud-starter-bus-amqp</literal> or <literal>spring-cloud-starter-bus-kafka</literal> to your dependency management and Spring Cloud takes care of the rest. Make sure the broker (RabbitMQ or Kafka) is available and configured: running on localhost you shouldn&#8217;t have to do anything, but if you are running remotely use Spring Cloud Connectors, or Spring Boot conventions to define the broker credentials, e.g. for Rabbit</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>spring:
  rabbitmq:
    host: mybroker.com
    port: 5672
    username: user
    password: secret</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>The bus currently supports sending messages to all nodes listening or all nodes for a particular service (as defined by Eureka).  More selector criteria may be added in the future (ie. only service X nodes in data center Y, etc&#8230;&#8203;). There are also some http endpoints under the <literal>/bus/*</literal> actuator namespace.  There are currently two implemented.  The first, <literal>/bus/env</literal>, sends key/value pairs to update each node&#8217;s Spring Environment.  The second, <literal>/bus/refresh</literal>, will reload each application&#8217;s configuration, just as if they had all been pinged on their <literal>/refresh</literal> endpoint.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The Bus starters cover Rabbit and Kafka, because those are the two most common implementations, but Spring Cloud Stream is quite flexible and binder will work combined with <literal>spring-cloud-bus</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_addressing_an_instance">
<title>Addressing an Instance</title>
<simpara>The HTTP endpoints accept a "destination" parameter, e.g. "/bus/refresh?destination=customers:9000", where the destination is an <literal>ApplicationContext</literal> ID. If the ID is owned by an instance on the Bus then it will process the message and all other instances will ignore it. Spring Boot sets the ID for you in the <literal>ContextIdApplicationContextInitializer</literal> to a combination of the <literal>spring.application.name</literal>, active profiles and <literal>server.port</literal> by default.</simpara>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_addressing_all_instances_of_a_service">
<title>Addressing all instances of a service</title>
<simpara>The "destination" parameter is used in a Spring <literal>PathMatcher</literal> (with the path separator as a colon <literal>:</literal>) to determine if an instance will process the message.   Using the example from above, "/bus/refresh?destination=customers:**" will  target  all instances of the "customers" service regardless of the profiles and ports set as the <literal>ApplicationContext</literal> ID.</simpara>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_application_context_id_must_be_unique">
<title>Application Context ID must be unique</title>
<simpara>The bus tries to eliminate processing an event twice, once from the original <literal>ApplicationEvent</literal> and once from the queue.  To do this, it checks the sending application context id againts the current application context id.  If multiple instances of a service have the same application context id, events will not be processed.  Running on a local machine, each service will be on a different port and that will be part of the application context id.  Cloud Foundry supplies an index to differentiate.  To ensure that the application context id is the unique, set <literal>spring.application.index</literal> to something unique for each instance of a service.  For example, in lattice, set <literal>spring.application.index=${INSTANCE_INDEX}</literal> in application.properties (or bootstrap.properties if using configserver).</simpara>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_customizing_the_message_broker">
<title>Customizing the Message Broker</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Bus uses
<link xl:href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream">Spring Cloud Stream</link> to
broadcast the messages so to get messages to flow you only need to
include the binder implementation of your choice in the
classpath. There are convenient starters specifically for the bus with
AMQP (RabbitMQ) and Kafka
(<literal>spring-cloud-starter-bus-[amqp,kafka]</literal>). Generally speaking
Spring Cloud Stream relies on Spring Boot autoconfiguration
conventions for configuring middleware, so for instance the AMQP
broker address can be changed with <literal>spring.rabbitmq.*</literal>
configuration properties. Spring Cloud Bus has a handful of native
configuration properties in <literal>spring.cloud.bus.*</literal>
(e.g. <literal>spring.cloud.bus.destination</literal> is the name of the topic to use
the the externall middleware). Normally the defaults will suffice.</simpara>
<simpara>To lean more about how to customize the message broker settings
consult the Spring Cloud Stream documentation.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_tracing_bus_events">
<title>Tracing Bus Events</title>
<simpara>Bus events (subclasses of <literal>RemoteApplicationEvent</literal>) can be traced by
setting <literal>spring.cloud.bus.trace.enabled=true</literal>. If you do this then the
Spring Boot <literal>TraceRepository</literal> (if it is present) will show each event
sent and all the acks from each service instance. Example (from the
<literal>/trace</literal> endpoint):</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
  "timestamp": "2015-11-26T10:24:44.411+0000",
  "info": {
    "signal": "spring.cloud.bus.ack",
    "type": "RefreshRemoteApplicationEvent",
    "id": "c4d374b7-58ea-4928-a312-31984def293b",

  }
  },
  {
  "timestamp": "2015-11-26T10:24:41.864+0000",
  "info": {
    "signal": "spring.cloud.bus.sent",
    "type": "RefreshRemoteApplicationEvent",
    "id": "c4d374b7-58ea-4928-a312-31984def293b",

    "origin": "customers:9000",
    "destination": "*:**"
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>This trace shows that a <literal>RefreshRemoteApplicationEvent</literal> was sent from
<literal>customers:9000</literal>, broadcast to all services, and it was received
(acked) by <literal>customers:9000</literal> and <literal>stores:8081</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To handle the ack signals yourself you could add an <literal>@EventListener</literal>
for the <literal>AckRemoteApplicationEvent</literal> and <literal>SentApplicationEvent</literal> types
to your app (and enable tracing). Or you could tap into the
<literal>TraceRepository</literal> and mine the data from there.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Any Bus application can trace acks, but sometimes it will be
useful to do this in a central service that can do more complex
queries on the data. Or forward it to a specialized tracing service.</simpara>
</note>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_broadcasting_your_own_events">
<title>Broadcasting Your Own Events</title>
<simpara>The Bus can carry any event of type <literal>RemoteApplicationEvent</literal>, but the
default transport is JSON and the deserializer needs to know which
types are going to be used ahead of time. To register a new type it
needs to be in a subpackage of <literal>org.springframework.cloud.bus.event</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To customise the event name you can use <literal>@JsonTypeName</literal> on your custom class
or rely on the default strategy which is to use the simple name of the class.
Note that both the producer and the consumer will need access to the class
definition.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_registering_events_in_custom_packages">
<title>Registering events in custom packages</title>
<simpara>If you cannot or don&#8217;t want to use a subpackage of <literal>org.springframework.cloud.bus.event</literal>
for your custom events, you must specify which packages to scan for events of
type <literal>RemoteApplicationEvent</literal> using <literal>@RemoteApplicationEventScan</literal>. Packages
specified with <literal>@RemoteApplicationEventScan</literal> include subpackages.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, if you have a custom event called <literal>FooEvent</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">package com.acme;

public class FooEvent extends RemoteApplicationEvent {
    ...
}</programlisting>
<simpara>you can register this event with the deserializer in the following way:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">package com.acme;

@Configuration
@RemoteApplicationEventScan
public class BusConfiguration {
    ...
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Without specifying a value, the package of the class where <literal>@RemoteApplicationEventScan</literal>
is used will be registered. In this example <literal>com.acme</literal> will be registered using the
package of <literal>BusConfiguration</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>You can also explicitly specify the packages to scan using the <literal>value</literal>, <literal>basePackages</literal> or
<literal>basePackageClasses</literal> properties on <literal>@RemoteApplicationEventScan</literal>. For example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">package com.acme;

@Configuration
//@RemoteApplicationEventScan({"com.acme", "foo.bar"})
//@RemoteApplicationEventScan(basePackages = {"com.acme", "foo.bar", "fizz.buzz"})
@RemoteApplicationEventScan(basePackageClasses = BusConfiguration.class)
public class BusConfiguration {
    ...
}</programlisting>
<simpara>All examples of <literal>@RemoteApplicationEventScan</literal> above are equivalent,
in that the <literal>com.acme</literal> package will be registered by explicitly specifying the
packages on <literal>@RemoteApplicationEventScan</literal>. Note, you can specify multiple base
packages to scan.</simpara>

<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Span:</emphasis> The basic unit of work. For example, sending an RPC is a new span, as is sending a response to an
RPC. Span&#8217;s are identified by a unique 64-bit ID for the span and another 64-bit ID for the trace the span
is a part of.  Spans also have other data, such as descriptions, timestamped events, key-value
annotations (tags), the ID of the span that caused them, and process ID&#8217;s (normally IP address).</simpara>
<simpara>Spans are started and stopped, and they keep track of their timing information.  Once you create a
span, you must stop it at some point in the future.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>The initial span that starts a trace is called a <literal>root span</literal>. The value of span id
of that span is equal to trace id.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Trace:</emphasis> A set of spans forming a tree-like structure.  For example, if you are running a distributed
big-data store, a trace might be formed by a put request.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Annotation:</emphasis>  is used to record existence of an event in time. Some of the core annotations used to define
the start and stop of a request are:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">cs</emphasis> - Client Sent - The client has made a request. This annotation depicts the start of the span.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">sr</emphasis> - Server Received -  The server side got the request and will start processing it.
If one subtracts the cs timestamp from this timestamp one will receive the network latency.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">ss</emphasis> - Server Sent -  Annotated upon completion of request processing (when the response
got sent back to the client). If one subtracts the sr timestamp from this timestamp one
will receive the time needed by the server side to process the request.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">cr</emphasis> - Client Received - Signifies the end of the span. The client has successfully received the
response from the server side. If one subtracts the cs timestamp from this timestamp one
will receive the whole time needed by the client to receive the response from the server.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<simpara>Each color of a note signifies a span (7 spans - from <emphasis role="strong">A</emphasis> to <emphasis role="strong">G</emphasis>). If you have such information in the note:</simpara>
<screen>Trace Id = X

<simpara>That means that the current span has <emphasis role="strong">Trace-Id</emphasis> set to <emphasis role="strong">X</emphasis>, <emphasis role="strong">Span-Id</emphasis> set to <emphasis role="strong">D</emphasis>. It also has emitted

<note>
<simpara>When picking a particular trace you will see merged spans. That means that if there were 2 spans sent to

annotations then they will presented as a single span.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Why is there a difference between the 7 and 4 spans in this case?</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>2 spans come from <literal>http:/start</literal> span. It has the Server Received (SR) and Server Sent (SS) annotations.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>2 spans come from the RPC call from <literal>service1</literal> to <literal>service2</literal> to the <literal>http:/foo</literal> endpoint. It has the Client Sent (CS)
and Client Received (CR) annotations on <literal>service1</literal> side. It also has Server Received (SR) and Server Sent (SS) annotations
on the <literal>service2</literal> side. Physically there are 2 spans but they form 1 logical span related to an RPC call.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>2 spans come from the RPC call from <literal>service2</literal> to <literal>service3</literal> to the <literal>http:/bar</literal> endpoint. It has the Client Sent (CS)
and Client Received (CR) annotations on <literal>service2</literal> side. It also has Server Received (SR) and Server Sent (SS) annotations
on the <literal>service3</literal> side. Physically there are 2 spans but they form 1 logical span related to an RPC call.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>2 spans come from the RPC call from <literal>service2</literal> to <literal>service4</literal> to the <literal>http:/baz</literal> endpoint. It has the Client Sent (CS)
and Client Received (CR) annotations on <literal>service2</literal> side. It also has Server Received (SR) and Server Sent (SS) annotations
on the <literal>service4</literal> side. Physically there are 2 spans but they form 1 logical span related to an RPC call.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>So if we count the physical spans we have <emphasis role="strong">1</emphasis> from <literal>http:/start</literal>, <emphasis role="strong">2</emphasis> from <literal>service1</literal> calling <literal>service2</literal>, <emphasis role="strong">2</emphasis> form <literal>service2</literal>
calling <literal>service3</literal> and <emphasis role="strong">2</emphasis> from <literal>service2</literal> calling <literal>service4</literal>. Altogether <emphasis role="strong">7</emphasis> spans.</simpara>
<simpara>Logically we see the information of <emphasis role="strong">Total Spans: 4</emphasis> because we have <emphasis role="strong">1</emphasis> span related to the incoming request
to <literal>service1</literal> and <emphasis role="strong">3</emphasis> spans related to RPC calls.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_propagating_span_context">
<title>Propagating Span Context</title>
<simpara>The span context is the state that must get propagated to any child Spans across process boundaries.
Part of the Span Context is the Baggage. The trace and span IDs are a required part of the span context.
Baggage is an optional part.</simpara>
<simpara>Baggage is a set of key:value pairs stored in the span context. Baggage travels together with the trace
and is attached to every span. Spring Cloud Sleuth will understand that a header is baggage related if the HTTP
 header is prefixed with <literal>baggage-</literal> and for messaging it starts with <literal>baggage_</literal>.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>There&#8217;s currently no limitation of the count or size of baggage items. However, keep in mind that
too many can decrease system throughput or increase RPC latency. In extreme cases, it could crash the app due
to exceeding transport-level message or header capacity.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>Example of setting baggage on a span:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">Span initialSpan = this.tracer.nextSpan().name("span").start();
try (Tracer.SpanInScope ws = this.tracer.withSpanInScope(initialSpan)) {
	ExtraFieldPropagation.set("foo", "bar");
	ExtraFieldPropagation.set("UPPER_CASE", "someValue");</programlisting>
<section xml:id="_baggage_vs_span_tags">
<title>Baggage vs. Span Tags</title>
<simpara>Baggage travels with the trace (i.e. every child span contains the baggage of its parent). Zipkin has no knowledge of
baggage and will not even receive that information.</simpara>
<simpara>Tags are attached to a specific span - they are presented for that particular span only. However you
can search by tag to find the trace, where there exists a span having the searched tag value.</simpara>
<simpara>If you want to be able to lookup a span based on baggage, you should add corresponding entry as a tag in the root span.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowired Tracer tracer;

Span span = tracer.getCurrentSpan();
String baggageKey = "key";
String baggageValue = "foo";
span.setBaggageItem(baggageKey, baggageValue);
tracer.addTag(baggageKey, baggageValue);</programlisting>

<chapter xml:id="_sampling">
<title>Sampling</title>
<simpara>In distributed tracing the data volumes can be very high so sampling
can be important (you usually don&#8217;t need to export all spans to get a
good picture of what is happening). Spring Cloud Sleuth has a
<literal>Sampler</literal> strategy that you can implement to take control of the
sampling algorithm. Samplers do not stop span (correlation) ids from
being generated, but they do prevent the tags and events being
attached and exported. By default you get a strategy that continues to
trace if a span is already active, but new ones are always marked as
non-exportable. If all your apps run with this sampler you will see
traces in logs, but not in any remote store. For testing the default
is often enough, and it probably is all you need if you are only using
the logs (e.g. with an ELK aggregator). If you are exporting span data
to Zipkin or Spring Cloud Stream, there is also an <literal>AlwaysSampler</literal>
that exports everything and a <literal>PercentageBasedSampler</literal> that samples a
fixed fraction of spans.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>the <literal>PercentageBasedSampler</literal> is the default if you are using
<literal>spring-cloud-sleuth-zipkin</literal> or <literal>spring-cloud-sleuth-stream</literal>. You can
configure the exports using <literal>spring.sleuth.sampler.percentage</literal>. The passed
value needs to be a double from <literal>0.0</literal> to <literal>1.0</literal> so it&#8217;s not a percentage.
For backwards compatibility reasons we&#8217;re not changing the property name.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>A sampler can be installed just by creating a bean definition, e.g:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public Sampler defaultSampler() {
	return new AlwaysSampler();
}</programlisting>
<tip>
<simpara>You can set the HTTP header <literal>X-B3-Flags</literal> to <literal>1</literal> or when doing messaging you can
set <literal>spanFlags</literal> header to <literal>1</literal>. Then the current span will be forced to be exportable
regardless of the sampling decision.</simpara>
</tip>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_instrumentation">
<title>Instrumentation</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Sleuth instruments all your Spring application
automatically, so you shouldn&#8217;t have to do anything to activate
it. The instrumentation is added using a variety of technologies
according to the stack that is available, e.g. for a servlet web
application we use a <literal>Filter</literal>, and for Spring Integration we use
<literal>ChannelInterceptors</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>You can customize the keys used in span tags. To limit the volume of
span data, by default an HTTP request will be tagged only with a
handful of metadata like the status code, host and URL. You can add
request headers by configuring <literal>spring.sleuth.keys.http.headers</literal> (a
list of header names).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Remember that tags are only collected and exported if there is a
<literal>Sampler</literal> that allows it (by default there is not, so there is no
danger of accidentally collecting too much data without configuring
something).</simpara>
</note>
<note>
<simpara>Currently the instrumentation in Spring Cloud Sleuth is eager - it means that
we&#8217;re actively trying to pass the tracing context between threads. Also timing events
are captured even when sleuth isn&#8217;t exporting data to a tracing system.
This approach may change in the future towards being lazy on this matter.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_naming_spans">
<title>Naming spans</title>
<simpara>Picking a span name is not a trivial task. Span name should depict an operation name. The name should
be low cardinality (e.g. not include identifiers).</simpara>
<simpara>Since there is a lot of instrumentation going on some of the span names will be
artificial like:</simpara>

<section xml:id="_creating_new_spans">
<title>Creating new spans</title>
<simpara>If you really don&#8217;t want to take care of creating local spans manually you can profit from the
<literal>@NewSpan</literal> annotation. Also we give you the <literal>@SpanTag</literal> annotation to add tags in an automated
fashion.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s look at some examples of usage.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@NewSpan
void testMethod();</programlisting>
<simpara>Annotating the method without any parameter will lead to a creation of a new span whose name
will be equal to annotated method name.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@NewSpan("customNameOnTestMethod4")
void testMethod4();</programlisting>
<simpara>If you provide the value in the annotation (either directly or via the <literal>name</literal> parameter) then
the created span will have the name as the provided value.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// method declaration
@NewSpan(name = "customNameOnTestMethod5")
void testMethod5(@SpanTag("testTag") String param);

// and method execution
this.testBean.testMethod5("test");</programlisting>
<simpara>You can combine both the name and a tag. Let&#8217;s focus on the latter. In this case whatever the value of
the annotated method&#8217;s parameter runtime value will be - that will be the value of the tag. In our sample
the tag key will be <literal>testTag</literal> and the tag value will be <literal>test</literal>.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@NewSpan(name = "customNameOnTestMethod3")
@Override
public void testMethod3() {
}</programlisting>
<simpara>You can place the <literal>@NewSpan</literal> annotation on both the class and an interface. If you override the
interface&#8217;s method and provide a different value of the <literal>@NewSpan</literal> annotation then the most
concrete one wins (in this case <literal>customNameOnTestMethod3</literal> will be set).</simpara>

<title>Customizations</title>
<simpara>Thanks to the <literal>SpanInjector</literal> and <literal>SpanExtractor</literal> you can customize the way spans
are created and propagated.</simpara>
<simpara>There are currently two built-in ways to pass tracing information between processes:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>via Spring Integration</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>via HTTP</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Span ids are extracted from Zipkin-compatible (B3) headers (either <literal>Message</literal>
or HTTP headers), to start or join an existing trace. Trace information is
injected into any outbound requests so the next hop can extract them.</simpara>
<simpara>The key change in comparison to the previous versions of Sleuth is that Sleuth is implementing
the Open Tracing&#8217;s <literal>TextMap</literal> notion. In Sleuth it&#8217;s called <literal>SpanTextMap</literal>. Basically the idea
is that any means of communication (e.g. message, http request, etc.) can be abstracted via
a <literal>SpanTextMap</literal>. This abstraction defines how one can insert data into the carrier and
how to retrieve it from there. Thanks to this if you want to instrument a new HTTP library
that uses a <literal>FooRequest</literal> as a mean of sending HTTP requests then you have to create an
implementation of  a <literal>SpanTextMap</literal> that delegates calls to <literal>FooRequest</literal> in terms of retrieval
and insertion of HTTP headers.</simpara>

<simpara>Sometimes you want to create a manual Span that will wrap a call to an external service which is not instrumented.
What you can do is to create a span with the <literal>peer.service</literal> tag that will contain a value of the service that you want to call.
Below you can see an example of a call to Redis that is wrapped in such a span.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">org.springframework.cloud.sleuth.Span newSpan = tracer.createSpan("redis");

<simpara>Remember not to add both <literal>peer.service</literal> tag and the <literal>SA</literal> tag! You have to add only <literal>peer.service</literal>.</simpara>
</important>
</section>
<section xml:id="_custom_service_name">
<title>Custom service name</title>
<simpara>By default Sleuth assumes that when you send a span to Zipkin, you want the span&#8217;s service name
 to be equal to <literal>spring.application.name</literal> value. That&#8217;s not always the case though. There
 are situations in which you want to explicitly provide a different service name for all spans coming
 from your application. To achieve that it&#8217;s enough to just pass the following property
 to your application to override that value (example for <literal>foo</literal> service name):</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.zipkin.service.name: foo</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_customization_of_reported_spans">
<title>Customization of reported spans</title>
<simpara>Before reporting spans to e.g. Zipkin you can be interested in modifying that span in some way.
 You can achieve that by using the <literal>SpanAdjuster</literal> interface.</simpara>
<simpara>Example of usage:</simpara>
<simpara>In Sleuth we&#8217;re generating spans with a fixed name. Some users want to modify the name depending on values
of tags. Implementation of the <literal>SpanAdjuster</literal> interface can be used to alter that name. Example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
SpanAdjuster customSpanAdjuster() {
    return span -&gt; span.toBuilder().name(scrub(span.getName())).build();
}</programlisting>
<simpara>This will lead in changing the name of the reported span just before it gets sent to Zipkin.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>Your <literal>SpanReporter</literal> should inject the <literal>SpanAdjuster</literal> and
 allow span manipulation before the actual reporting is done.</simpara>
</important>
</section>
<section xml:id="_host_locator">
<title>Host locator</title>
<simpara>In order to define the host that is corresponding to a particular span we need to resolve the host name

then we&#8217;re trying to retrieve the host name from the network interfaces.</simpara>
<simpara>If you have the discovery client enabled and prefer to retrieve the host address from the registered
instance in a service registry then you have to set the property (it&#8217;s applicable for both HTTP and
Stream based span reporting).</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_sending_spans_to_zipkin">
<title>Sending spans to Zipkin</title>
<simpara>By default if you add <literal>spring-cloud-starter-zipkin</literal> as a dependency to your project,
when the span is closed, it will be sent to Zipkin over HTTP. The communication
is asynchronous. You can configure the URL by setting the <literal>spring.zipkin.baseUrl</literal>
property as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.zipkin.baseUrl: http://192.168.99.100:9411/</programlisting>
<simpara>If you want to find Zipkin via service discovery it&#8217;s enough to pass the

including the <literal>spring-cloud-sleuth-stream</literal> jar as a dependency, and
adding a Channel Binder implementation
(e.g. <literal>spring-cloud-starter-stream-rabbit</literal> for RabbitMQ or
<literal>spring-cloud-starter-stream-kafka</literal> for Kafka). This will
automatically turn your app into a producer of messages with payload
type <literal>Spans</literal>. The channel name to which the spans will be sent
is called <literal>sleuth</literal>.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_zipkin_consumer">
<title>Zipkin Consumer</title>
<simpara>There is a special convenience annotation for setting up a message consumer

<simpara>will listen for the Span data on whatever transport you provide via a
Spring Cloud Stream <literal>Binder</literal> (e.g. include
<literal>spring-cloud-starter-stream-rabbit</literal> for RabbitMQ, and similar
starters exist for Redis and Kafka). If you add the following UI dependency</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;groupId&gt;io.zipkin.java&lt;/groupId&gt;
&lt;artifactId&gt;zipkin-autoconfigure-ui&lt;/artifactId&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Then you&#8217;ll have your app a
<link xl:href="https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin">Zipkin server</link>, which hosts
the UI and api on port 9411.</simpara>
<simpara>The default <literal>SpanStore</literal> is in-memory (good for demos and getting
started quickly). For a more robust solution you can add MySQL and
<literal>spring-boot-starter-jdbc</literal> to your classpath and enable the JDBC
<literal>SpanStore</literal> via configuration, e.g.:</simpara>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring:

  datasource:

    password: root
# Switch this on to create the schema on startup:
    initialize: true
    continueOnError: true
  sleuth:
    enabled: false
zipkin:
  storage:
    type: mysql</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>The <literal>@EnableZipkinStreamServer</literal> is also annotated with

<section xml:id="_custom_consumer">
<title>Custom Consumer</title>
<simpara>A custom consumer can also easily be implemented using

@SpringBootApplication(exclude = SleuthStreamAutoConfiguration.class)
@MessageEndpoint
public class Consumer {

    @ServiceActivator(inputChannel = SleuthSink.INPUT)
    public void sink(Spans input) throws Exception {
        // ... process spans
    }
}</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara>the sample consumer application above explicitly excludes
<literal>SleuthStreamAutoConfiguration</literal> so it doesn&#8217;t send messages to itself,
but this is optional (you might actually want to trace requests into
the consumer app).</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>In order to customize the polling mechanism you can create a bean of <literal>PollerMetadata</literal> type
with name equal to <literal>StreamSpanReporter.POLLER</literal>. Here you can find an example of such a configuration.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Configuration

<title>Service Discovery with Consul</title>
<simpara>Service Discovery is one of the key tenets of a microservice based architecture. Trying to hand configure each client or some form of convention can be very difficult to do and can be very brittle.  Consul provides Service Discovery services via an <link xl:href="https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/http.html">HTTP API</link> and <link xl:href="https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/dns.html">DNS</link>.  Spring Cloud Consul leverages the HTTP API for service registration and discovery.  This does not prevent non-Spring Cloud applications from leveraging the DNS interface.  Consul Agents servers are run in a <link xl:href="https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/architecture.html">cluster</link> that communicates via a <link xl:href="https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/gossip.html">gossip protocol</link> and uses the <link xl:href="https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/consensus.html">Raft consensus protocol</link>.</simpara>

</section>
<section xml:id="_registering_with_consul">
<title>Registering with Consul</title>
<simpara>When a client registers with Consul, it provides meta-data about itself such as host and port, id, name and tags.  An HTTP <link xl:href="https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/checks.html">Check</link> is created by default that Consul hits the <literal>/health</literal> endpoint every 10 seconds.  If the health check fails, the service instance is marked as critical.</simpara>
<simpara>Example Consul client:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class Application {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home() {

    }

}</programlisting>
<simpara>(i.e. utterly normal Spring Boot app).  If the Consul client is located somewhere other than <literal>localhost:8500</literal>, the configuration is required to locate the client. Example:</simpara>
<formalpara>

<para>
<screen>spring:

<simpara>If you use <link linkend="spring-cloud-consul-config">Spring Cloud Consul Config</link>, the above values will need to be placed in <literal>bootstrap.yml</literal> instead of <literal>application.yml</literal>.</simpara>
</caution>
<simpara>The default service name, instance id and port, taken from the <literal>Environment</literal>, are <literal>${spring.application.name}</literal>, the Spring Context ID and <literal>${server.port}</literal> respectively.</simpara>
<simpara>To disable the Consul Discovery Client you can set <literal>spring.cloud.consul.discovery.enabled</literal> to <literal>false</literal>.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_http_health_check">
<title>HTTP Health Check</title>
<simpara>The health check for a Consul instance defaults to "/health", which is the default locations of a useful endpoint in a Spring Boot Actuator application. You need to change these, even for an Actuator application if you use a non-default context path or servlet path (e.g. <literal>server.servletPath=/foo</literal>) or management endpoint path (e.g. <literal>management.context-path=/admin</literal>). The interval that Consul uses to check the health endpoint may also be configured.  "10s" and "1m" represent 10 seconds and 1 minute respectively.  Example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>spring:
  cloud:
    consul:
      discovery:
        healthCheckPath: ${management.context-path}/health

<section xml:id="_metadata_and_consul_tags">
<title>Metadata and Consul tags</title>
<simpara>Consul does not yet support metadata on services. Spring Cloud&#8217;s <literal>ServiceInstance</literal> has a <literal>Map&lt;String, String&gt; metadata</literal> field. Spring Cloud Consul uses Consul tags to approximate metadata until Consul officially supports metadata. Tags with the form <literal>key=value</literal> will be split and used as a <literal>Map</literal> key and value respectively. Tags without the equal <literal>=</literal> sign, will be used as both the key and value.</simpara>
<formalpara>

</section>
<section xml:id="_making_the_consul_instance_id_unique">
<title>Making the Consul Instance ID Unique</title>
<simpara>By default a consul instance is registered with an ID that is equal to its Spring Application Context ID. By default, the Spring Application Context ID is <literal>${spring.application.name}:comma,separated,profiles:${server.port}</literal>. For most cases, this will allow multiple instances of one service to run on one machine.  If further uniqueness is required, Using Spring Cloud you can override this by providing a unique identifier in <literal>spring.cloud.consul.discovery.instanceId</literal>. For example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>spring:
  cloud:
    consul:
      discovery:
        instanceId: ${spring.application.name}:${vcap.application.instance_id:${spring.application.instance_id:${random.value}}}</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>With this metadata, and multiple service instances deployed on localhost, the random value will kick in there to make the instance unique. In Cloudfoundry the <literal>vcap.application.instance_id</literal> will be populated automatically in a Spring Boot application, so the random value will not be needed.</simpara>

<simpara>If you want to access service STORES using the RestTemplate simply declare:</simpara>
<screen>@LoadBalanced

<title>Distributed Configuration with Consul</title>
<simpara>Consul provides a <link xl:href="https://consul.io/docs/agent/http/kv.html">Key/Value Store</link> for storing configuration and other metadata.  Spring Cloud Consul Config is an alternative to the <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config">Config Server and Client</link>.  Configuration is loaded into the Spring Environment during the special "bootstrap" phase.  Configuration is stored in the <literal>/config</literal> folder by default.  Multiple <literal>PropertySource</literal> instances are created based on the application&#8217;s name and the active profiles that mimicks the Spring Cloud Config order of resolving properties.  For example, an application with the name "testApp" and with the "dev" profile will have the following property sources created:</simpara>
<screen>config/testApp,dev/
config/testApp/
config/application,dev/
config/application/</screen>
<simpara>The most specific property source is at the top, with the least specific at the bottom.  Properties in the <literal>config/application</literal> folder are applicable to all applications using consul for configuration.  Properties in the <literal>config/testApp</literal> folder are only available to the instances of the service named "testApp".</simpara>
<simpara>Configuration is currently read on startup of the application.  Sending a HTTP POST to <literal>/refresh</literal> will cause the configuration to be reloaded. <xref linkend="spring-cloud-consul-config-watch"/> will also automatically detect changes and reload the application context.</simpara>

<title>Setting up Zookeeper Dependencies</title>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at an example of dependencies representation:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<screen>spring.application.name: yourServiceName
spring.cloud.zookeeper:
  dependencies:
    newsletter:
      path: /path/where/newsletter/has/registered/in/zookeeper
      loadBalancerType: ROUND_ROBIN

      version: v1
      headers:
        header1:

      contentTypeTemplate: application/vnd.mailing.$version+json
      version: v1
      required: true</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s now go through each part of the dependency one by one. The root property name is <literal>spring.cloud.zookeeper.dependencies</literal>.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_aliases">
<title>Aliases</title>
<simpara>Below the root property you have to represent each dependency has by an alias due to the constraints of Ribbon (the application id has to be placed in the URL
thus you can&#8217;t pass any complex path like /foo/bar/name). The alias will be the name that you will use instead of serviceId for <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal>, <literal>Feign</literal> or <literal>RestTemplate</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>In the aforementioned examples the aliases are <literal>newsletter</literal> and <literal>mailing</literal>. Example of Feign usage with <literal>newsletter</literal> would be:</simpara>
<screen>@FeignClient("newsletter")
public interface NewsletterService {
        @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value = "/newsletter")
        String getNewsletters();
}</screen>
</section>
<section xml:id="_path">
<title>Path</title>
<simpara>Represented by <literal>path</literal> yaml property.</simpara>
<simpara>Path is the path under which the dependency is registered under Zookeeper. Like presented before Ribbon operates on URLs thus this path is not compliant with its requirement.
That is why Spring Cloud Zookeeper maps the alias to the proper path.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_load_balancer_type">
<title>Load balancer type</title>
<simpara>Represented by <literal>loadBalancerType</literal> yaml property.</simpara>
<simpara>If you know what kind of load balancing strategy has to be applied when calling this particular dependency then you can provide it in the yaml file and it will be automatically applied.
You can choose one of the following load balancing strategies</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>STICKY - once chosen the instance will always be called</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>RANDOM - picks an instance randomly</simpara>

<section xml:id="_content_type_template_and_version">
<title>Content-Type template and version</title>
<simpara>Represented by <literal>contentTypeTemplate</literal> and <literal>version</literal> yaml property.</simpara>
<simpara>If you version your api via the <literal>Content-Type</literal> header then you don&#8217;t want to add this header to each of your requests. Also if you want to call a new version of the API you don&#8217;t want to
roam around your code to bump up the API version. That&#8217;s why you can provide a <literal>contentTypeTemplate</literal> with a special <literal>$version</literal> placeholder. That placeholder will be filled by the value of the
<literal>version</literal> yaml property. Let&#8217;s take a look at an example.</simpara>
<simpara>Having the following <literal>contentTypeTemplate</literal>:</simpara>
<screen>application/vnd.newsletter.$version+json</screen>
<simpara>and the following <literal>version</literal>:</simpara>
<screen>v1</screen>
<simpara>Will result in setting up of a <literal>Content-Type</literal> header for each request:</simpara>
<screen>application/vnd.newsletter.v1+json</screen>
</section>
<section xml:id="_default_headers">
<title>Default headers</title>
<simpara>Represented by <literal>headers</literal> map in yaml</simpara>
<simpara>Sometimes each call to a dependency requires setting up of some default headers. In order not to do that in code you can set them up in the yaml file.
Having the following <literal>headers</literal> section:</simpara>
<screen>headers:
    Accept:
        - text/html
        - application/xhtml+xml
    Cache-Control:
        - no-cache</screen>
<simpara>Results in adding the <literal>Accept</literal> and <literal>Cache-Control</literal> headers with appropriate list of values in your HTTP request.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_obligatory_dependencies">
<title>Obligatory dependencies</title>
<simpara>Represented by <literal>required</literal> property in yaml</simpara>
<simpara>If one of your dependencies is required to be up and running when your application is booting then it&#8217;s enough to set up the <literal>required: true</literal> property in the yaml file.</simpara>
<simpara>If your application can&#8217;t localize the required dependency during boot time it will throw an exception and the Spring Context will fail to set up.
In other words your application won&#8217;t be able to start if the required dependency is not registered in Zookeeper.</simpara>
<simpara>You can read more about Spring Cloud Zookeeper Presence Checker in the following sections.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_stubs">
<title>Stubs</title>
<simpara>You can provide a colon separated path to the JAR containing stubs of the dependency. Example</simpara>
<screen>stubs: org.springframework:foo:stubs</screen>
<simpara>means that for a particular dependencies can be found under:</simpara>

<simpara>Zookeeper provides a <link xl:href="http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperOver.html#sc_dataModelNameSpace">hierarchical namespace</link> that allows clients to store arbitrary data, such as configuration data.  Spring Cloud Zookeeper Config is an alternative to the <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config">Config Server and Client</link>.  Configuration is loaded into the Spring Environment during the special "bootstrap" phase.  Configuration is stored in the <literal>/config</literal> namespace by default.  Multiple <literal>PropertySource</literal> instances are created based on the application&#8217;s name and the active profiles that mimicks the Spring Cloud Config order of resolving properties.  For example, an application with the name "testApp" and with the "dev" profile will have the following property sources created:</simpara>
<screen>config/testApp,dev
config/testApp
config/application,dev
config/application</screen>
<simpara>The most specific property source is at the top, with the least specific at the bottom.  Properties is the <literal>config/application</literal> namespace are applicable to all applications using zookeeper for configuration.  Properties in the <literal>config/testApp</literal> namespace are only available to the instances of the service named "testApp".</simpara>
<simpara>Configuration is currently read on startup of the application.  Sending a HTTP POST to <literal>/refresh</literal> will cause the configuration to be reloaded.

<title>Spring Cloud Security</title>
<partintro>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Security offers a set of primitives for building secure
applications and services with minimum fuss. A declarative model which
can be heavily configured externally (or centrally) lends itself to
the implementation of large systems of co-operating, remote components,
usually with a central indentity management service. It is also extremely
easy to use in a service platform like Cloud Foundry. Building on
Spring Boot and Spring Security OAuth2 we can quickly create systems that
implement common patterns like single sign on, token relay and token
exchange.</simpara>

<title>Token Relay</title>
<simpara>A Token Relay is where an OAuth2 consumer acts as a Client and
forwards the incoming token to outgoing resource requests. The
consumer can be a pure Client (like an SSO application) or a Resource
Server.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_client_token_relay">
<title>Client Token Relay</title>
<simpara>If your app is a user facing OAuth2 client (i.e. has declared
<literal>@EnableOAuth2Sso</literal> or <literal>@EnableOAuth2Client</literal>) then it has an
<literal>OAuth2ClientContext</literal> in request scope from Spring Boot. You can
create your own <literal>OAuth2RestTemplate</literal> from this context and an
autowired <literal>OAuth2ProtectedResourceDetails</literal>, and then the context will
always forward the access token downstream, also refreshing the access
token automatically if it expires. (These are features of Spring
Security and Spring Boot.)</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Spring Boot (1.4.1) does not create an
<literal>OAuth2ProtectedResourceDetails</literal> automatically if you are using
<literal>client_credentials</literal> tokens. In that case you need to create your own
<literal>ClientCredentialsResourceDetails</literal> and configure it with
<literal>@ConfigurationProperties("security.oauth2.client")</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_client_token_relay_in_zuul_proxy">
<title>Client Token Relay in Zuul Proxy</title>
<simpara>If your app also has a
<link xl:href="http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud.html#netflix-zuul-reverse-proxy">Spring
Cloud Zuul</link> embedded reverse proxy (using <literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal>) then you
can ask it to forward OAuth2 access tokens downstream to the services
it is proxying. Thus the SSO app above can be enhanced simply like
this:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>app.groovy</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Controller
@EnableOAuth2Sso
@EnableZuulProxy
class Application {

}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>and it will (in addition to logging the user in and grabbing a token)
pass the authentication token downstream to the <literal>/proxy/*</literal>
services. If those services are implemented with
<literal>@EnableResourceServer</literal> then they will get a valid token in the
correct header.</simpara>
<simpara>How does it work? The <literal>@EnableOAuth2Sso</literal> annotation pulls in
<literal>spring-cloud-starter-security</literal> (which you could do manually in a
traditional app), and that in turn triggers some autoconfiguration for
a <literal>ZuulFilter</literal>, which itself is activated because Zuul is on the
classpath (via <literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal>). The
<link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-security/tree/master/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/security/oauth2/proxy/OAuth2TokenRelayFilter.java">filter</link>
just extracts an access token from the currently authenticated user,
and puts it in a request header for the downstream requests.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_resource_server_token_relay">
<title>Resource Server Token Relay</title>
<simpara>If your app has <literal>@EnableResourceServer</literal> you might want to relay the
incoming token downstream to other services. If you use a
<literal>RestTemplate</literal> to contact the downstream services then this is just a
matter of how to create the template with the right context.</simpara>
<simpara>If your service uses <literal>UserInfoTokenServices</literal> to authenticate incoming
tokens (i.e. it is using the <literal>security.oauth2.user-info-uri</literal>
configuration), then you can simply create an <literal>OAuth2RestTemplate</literal>
using an autowired <literal>OAuth2ClientContext</literal> (it will be populated by the
authentication process before it hits the backend code). Equivalently
(with Spring Boot 1.4), you could inject a
<literal>UserInfoRestTemplateFactory</literal> and grab its <literal>OAuth2RestTemplate</literal> in
your configuration. For example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>MyConfiguration.java</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public OAuth2RestTemplate restTemplate(UserInfoRestTemplateFactory factory) {
    return factory.getUserInfoRestTemplate();
}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>This rest template will then have the same <literal>OAuth2ClientContext</literal>
(request-scoped) that is used by the authentication filter, so you can
use it to send requests with the same access token.</simpara>
<simpara>If your app is not using <literal>UserInfoTokenServices</literal> but is still a client
(i.e. it declares <literal>@EnableOAuth2Client</literal> or <literal>@EnableOAuth2Sso</literal>), then
with Spring Security Cloud any <literal>OAuth2RestOperations</literal> that the user
creates from an <literal>@Autowired</literal> <literal>@OAuth2Context</literal> will also forward
tokens. This feature is implemented by default as an MVC handler
interceptor, so it only works in Spring MVC. If you are not using MVC
you could use a custom filter or AOP interceptor wrapping an
<literal>AccessTokenContextRelay</literal> to provide the same feature.</simpara>
<simpara>Here&#8217;s a basic
example showing the use of an autowired rest template created
elsewhere ("foo.com" is a Resource Server accepting the same tokens as
the surrounding app):</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>MyController.java</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Autowired
private OAuth2RestOperations restTemplate;

@RequestMapping("/relay")
public String relay() {
    ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; response =
      restTemplate.getForEntity("https://foo.com/bar", String.class);
    return "Success! (" + response.getBody() + ")";
}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>If you don&#8217;t want to forward tokens (and that is a valid
choice, since you might want to act as yourself, rather than the
client that sent you the token), then you only need to create your own
<literal>OAuth2Context</literal> instead of autowiring the default one.</simpara>
<simpara>Feign clients will also pick up an interceptor that uses the
<literal>OAuth2ClientContext</literal> if it is available, so they should also do a
token relay anywhere where a <literal>RestTemplate</literal> would.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_configuring_authentication_downstream_of_a_zuul_proxy">
<title>Configuring Authentication Downstream of a Zuul Proxy</title>
<simpara>You can control the authorization behaviour downstream of an
<literal>@EnableZuulProxy</literal> through the <literal>proxy.auth.*</literal> settings. Example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>application.yml</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">proxy:
  auth:
    routes:
      customers: oauth2
      stores: passthru
      recommendations: none</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>In this example the "customers" service gets an OAuth2 token relay,
the "stores" service gets a passthrough (the authorization header is
just passed downstream), and the "recommendations" service has its
authorization header removed. The default behaviour is to do a token
relay if there is a token available, and passthru otherwise.</simpara>

<simpara>Spring Cloud for Cloudfoundry makes it easy to run
<link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud">Spring Cloud</link> apps in
<link xl:href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry">Cloud Foundry</link> (the Platform as a
Service). Cloud Foundry has the notion of a "service", which is
middlware that you "bind" to an app, essentially providing it with an
environment variable containing credentials (e.g. the location and
username to use for the service).</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>spring-cloud-cloudfoundry-web</literal> project provides basic support for
some enhanced features of webapps in Cloud Foundry: binding
automatically to single-sign-on services and optionally enabling
sticky routing for discovery.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>spring-cloud-cloudfoundry-discovery</literal> project provides an
implementation of Spring Cloud Commons <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> so you can
<literal>@EnableDiscoveryClient</literal> and provide your credentials as
<literal>spring.cloud.cloudfoundry.discovery.[email,password]</literal> and then you
can use the <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> directly or via a <literal>LoadBalancerClient</literal>
(also <literal>*.url</literal> if you are not connecting to
<link xl:href="https://run.pivotal.io">Pivotal Web Services</link>).</simpara>
<simpara>The first time you use it the discovery client might be slow owing to
the fact that it has to get an access token from Cloud Foundry.</simpara>

<simpara>If you run it without any service bindings:</simpara>
<screen>$ spring jar app.jar app.groovy
$ cf push -p app.jar</screen>
<simpara>It will show its app name in the home page.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> can lists all the apps in a space, according to
the credentials it is authenticated with, where the space defaults to
the one the client is running in (if any). If neither org nor space

<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier&#8217;s purpose is NOT to start writing business
features in the contracts. Assume that we have a business use case of fraud check. If a
user can be a fraud for 100 different reasons, we would assume that you would create 2
contracts, one for the positive case and one for the negative case. Contract tests are
used to test contracts between applications and not to simulate full behavior.</simpara>

<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Write the missing implementation.</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>At some point in time, you need to send a request to the Fraud Detection service. Assume
that you need to send the request containing the ID of the client and the amount the

<simpara>Place the contract under <literal>src/test/resources/contracts/fraud</literal> folder. The <literal>fraud</literal> folder

<simpara>The YML contract is quite straight-forward. However when you take a look at the Contract
written using a statically typed Groovy DSL - you might wonder what the
<literal>value(client(&#8230;&#8203;), server(&#8230;&#8203;))</literal> parts are. By using this notation, Spring Cloud
Contract lets you define parts of a JSON block, a URL, etc., which are dynamic. In case
of an identifier or a timestamp, you need not hardcode a value. You want to allow some
different ranges of values. To enable ranges of values, you can set regular expressions
matching those values for the consumer side. You can provide the body by means of either
a map notation or String with interpolations.
<link xl:href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html#_contract_dsl">Consult the docs
for more information.</link> We highly recommend using the map notation!</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>You must understand the map notation in order to set up contracts. Please read the
<link xl:href="http://groovy-lang.org/json.html">Groovy docs regarding JSON</link>.</simpara>

<simpara>The previously shown contract is an agreement between two sides that:</simpara>

<simpara>Once you are ready to check the API in practice in the integration tests, you need to

<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Add the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier plugin.</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>We can add either a Maven or a Gradle plugin. In this example, you see how to add Maven.
First, add the <literal>Spring Cloud Contract</literal> BOM.</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;dependencyManagement&gt;
	&lt;dependencies&gt;
		&lt;dependency&gt;
			&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;

			&lt;version&gt;${spring-cloud-dependencies.version}&lt;/version&gt;
			&lt;type&gt;pom&lt;/type&gt;
			&lt;scope&gt;import&lt;/scope&gt;
		&lt;/dependency&gt;
	&lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Next, add the <literal>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier</literal> Maven plugin</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;plugin&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;

&lt;/plugin&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Since the plugin was added, you get the <literal>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier</literal> features which,
from the provided contracts:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>generate and run tests</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>produce and install stubs</simpara>
</listitem>

<simpara>You do not want to generate tests since you, as the consumer, want only to play with the
stubs. You need to skip the test generation and execution. When you execute:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ cd local-http-server-repo

<simpara>In the logs, you see something like this:</simpara>

capitalize <literal>fraud</literal>. That gives you the <literal>FraudBase</literal> test class name.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>All the generated tests extend that class. Over there, you can set up your Spring Context
or whatever is necessary. In this case, use <link xl:href="http://rest-assured.io/">Rest Assured MVC</link> to
start the server side <literal>FraudDetectionController</literal>.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">package com.example.fraud;

	public void assertThatRejectionReasonIsNull(Object rejectionReason) {

}</programlisting>
<simpara>Now, if you run the <literal>./mvnw clean install</literal>, you get something like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">Results :

Tests in error:
  ContractVerifierTest.validate_shouldMarkClientAsFraud:32 » IllegalState Parsed...</programlisting>
<simpara>This error occurs because you have a new contract from which a test was generated and it
failed since you have not implemented the feature. The auto-generated test would look
like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Test
public void validate_shouldMarkClientAsFraud() throws Exception {
    // given:
        MockMvcRequestSpecification request = given()
                .header("Content-Type", "application/vnd.fraud.v1+json")
                .body("{\"client.id\":\"1234567890\",\"loanAmount\":99999}");

    // when:
        ResponseOptions response = given().spec(request)
                .put("/fraudcheck");

    // then:
        assertThat(response.statusCode()).isEqualTo(200);
        assertThat(response.header("Content-Type")).matches("application/vnd.fraud.v1.json.*");
    // and:
        DocumentContext parsedJson = JsonPath.parse(response.getBody().asString());
        assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("['fraudCheckStatus']").matches("[A-Z]{5}");
        assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("['rejection.reason']").isEqualTo("Amount too high");
}</programlisting>
<simpara>If you used the Groovy DSL, you can see, all the <literal>producer()</literal> parts of the Contract that were present in the
<literal>value(consumer(&#8230;&#8203;), producer(&#8230;&#8203;))</literal> blocks got injected into the test.
In case of using YAML, the same applied for the <literal>matchers</literal> sections of the <literal>response</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Note that, on the producer side, you are also doing TDD. The expectations are expressed
in the form of a test. This test sends a request to our own application with the URL,
headers, and body defined in the contract. It also is expecting precisely defined values
in the response. In other words, you have the <literal>red</literal> part of <literal>red</literal>, <literal>green</literal>, and
<literal>refactor</literal>. It is time to convert the <literal>red</literal> into the <literal>green</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Write the missing implementation.</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>Because you know the expected input and expected output, you can write the missing
implementation:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RequestMapping(value = "/fraudcheck", method = PUT)
public FraudCheckResult fraudCheck(@RequestBody FraudCheck fraudCheck) {
if (amountGreaterThanThreshold(fraudCheck)) {
	return new FraudCheckResult(FraudCheckStatus.FRAUD, AMOUNT_TOO_HIGH);
}
return new FraudCheckResult(FraudCheckStatus.OK, NO_REASON);
}</programlisting>
<simpara>When you execute <literal>./mvnw clean install</literal> again, the tests pass. Since the <literal>Spring Cloud
Contract Verifier</literal> plugin adds the tests to the <literal>generated-test-sources</literal>, you can
actually run those tests from your IDE.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Deploy your app.</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>Once you finish your work, you can deploy your change. First, merge the branch:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ git checkout master
$ git merge --no-ff contract-change-pr
$ git push origin master</programlisting>
<simpara>Your CI might run something like <literal>./mvnw clean deploy</literal>, which would publish both the
application and the stub artifacts.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_what_is_this_value_consumer_producer">
<title>What is this value(consumer(), producer()) ?</title>
<simpara>One of the biggest challenges related to stubs is their reusability. Only if they can be vastly used, will they serve their purpose.
What typically makes that difficult are the hard-coded values of request / response elements. For example dates or ids.
Imagine the following JSON request</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
    "time" : "2016-10-10 20:10:15",
    "id" : "9febab1c-6f36-4a0b-88d6-3b6a6d81cd4a",
    "body" : "foo"
}</programlisting>
<simpara>and JSON response</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
    "time" : "2016-10-10 21:10:15",
    "id" : "c4231e1f-3ca9-48d3-b7e7-567d55f0d051",
    "body" : "bar"
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Imagine the pain required to set proper value of the <literal>time</literal> field (let&#8217;s assume that this content is generated by the
database) by changing the clock in the system or providing stub implementations of data providers. The same is related
to the field called <literal>id</literal>. Will you create a stubbed implementation of UUID generator? Makes little sense&#8230;&#8203;</simpara>
<simpara>So as a consumer you would like to send a request that matches any form of a time or any UUID. That way your system
will work as usual - will generate data and you won&#8217;t have to stub anything out. Let&#8217;s assume that in case of the aforementioned
JSON the most important part is the <literal>body</literal> field. You can focus on that and provide matching for other fields. In other words
you would like the stub to work like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
    "time" : "SOMETHING THAT MATCHES TIME",
    "id" : "SOMETHING THAT MATCHES UUID",
    "body" : "foo"
}</programlisting>
<simpara>As far as the response goes as a consumer you need a concrete value that you can operate on. So such a JSON is valid</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
    "time" : "2016-10-10 21:10:15",
    "id" : "c4231e1f-3ca9-48d3-b7e7-567d55f0d051",
    "body" : "bar"
}</programlisting>
<simpara>As you could see in the previous sections we generate tests from contracts. So from the producer&#8217;s side the situation looks
much different. We&#8217;re parsing the provided contract and in the test we want to send a real request to your endpoints.
So for the case of a producer for the request we can&#8217;t have any sort of matching. We need concrete values that the
producer&#8217;s backend can work on. Such a JSON would be a valid one:</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
    "time" : "2016-10-10 20:10:15",
    "id" : "9febab1c-6f36-4a0b-88d6-3b6a6d81cd4a",
    "body" : "foo"
}</programlisting>
<simpara>On the other hand from the point of view of the validity of the contract the response doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to
contain concrete values of <literal>time</literal> or <literal>id</literal>. Let&#8217;s say that you generate those on the producer side - again, you&#8217;d
have to do a lot of stubbing to ensure that you always return the same values. That&#8217;s why from the producer&#8217;s side
what you might want is the following response:</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
    "time" : "SOMETHING THAT MATCHES TIME",
    "id" : "SOMETHING THAT MATCHES UUID",
    "body" : "bar"
}</programlisting>
<simpara>How can you then provide one time a matcher for the consumer and a concrete value for the producer and vice versa?
In Spring Cloud Contract we&#8217;re allowing you to provide a <emphasis role="strong">dynamic value</emphasis>. That means that it can differ for both
sides of the communication. You can pass the values:</simpara>
<simpara>Either via the <literal>value</literal> method</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">value(consumer(...), producer(...))
value(stub(...), test(...))
value(client(...), server(...))</programlisting>
<simpara>or using the <literal>$()</literal> method</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">$(consumer(...), producer(...))
$(stub(...), test(...))
$(client(...), server(...))</programlisting>
<simpara>You can read more about this in the <link xl:href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html#_contract_dsl">Contract DSL section</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>Calling <literal>value()</literal> or <literal>$()</literal> tells Spring Cloud Contract that you will be passing a dynamic value.
Inside the <literal>consumer()</literal> method you pass the value that should be used on the consumer side (in the generated stub).
Inside the <literal>producer()</literal> method you pass the value that should be used on the producer side (in the generated test).</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>If on one side you have passed the regular expression and you haven&#8217;t passed the other, then the
other side will get auto-generated.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>Most often you will use that method together with the <literal>regex</literal> helper method. E.g. <literal>consumer(regex('[0-9]{10}'))</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To sum it up the contract for the aforementioned scenario would look more or less like this (the regular expression
for time and UUID are simplified and most likely invalid but we want to keep things very simple in this example):</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
				request {
					method 'GET'
					url '/someUrl'
					body([
					    time : value(consumer(regex('[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2} [0-2][0-9]-[0-5][0-9]-[0-5][0-9]')),
					    id: value(consumer(regex('[0-9a-zA-z]{8}-[0-9a-zA-z]{4}-[0-9a-zA-z]{4}-[0-9a-zA-z]{12}'))
					    body: "foo"
					])
				}
			response {
				status 200
				body([
					    time : value(producer(regex('[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2} [0-2][0-9]-[0-5][0-9]-[0-5][0-9]')),
					    id: value([producer(regex('[0-9a-zA-z]{8}-[0-9a-zA-z]{4}-[0-9a-zA-z]{4}-[0-9a-zA-z]{12}'))
					    body: "bar"
					])
			}
}</programlisting>

properly structure the request / response bodies.</simpara>

<title>API Versioning</title>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s try to answer a question what versioning really means. If you&#8217;re referring to the API version then there are
different approaches.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>use Hypermedia, links and do not version your API by any means</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>pass versions through headers / urls</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>I will not try to answer a question which approach is better. Whatever suit your needs and allows you to generate
business value should be picked.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s assume that you do version your API. In that case you should provide as many contracts as many versions you support.
You can create a subfolder for every version or append it to th contract name - whatever suits you more.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_jar_versioning">
<title>JAR versioning</title>
<simpara>If by versioning you mean the version of the JAR that contains the stubs then there are essentially two main approaches.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s assume that you&#8217;re doing Continuous Delivery / Deployment which means that you&#8217;re generating a new version of
the jar each time you go through the pipeline and that jar can go to production at any time. For example your jar version
looks like this (it got built on the 20.10.2016 at 20:15:21) :</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">1.0.0.20161020-201521-RELEASE</programlisting>
<simpara>In that case your generated stub jar will look like this.</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">1.0.0.20161020-201521-RELEASE-stubs.jar</programlisting>
<simpara>In this case you should inside your <literal>application.yml</literal> or <literal>@AutoConfigureStubRunner</literal> when referencing stubs provide the
 latest version of the stubs. You can do that by passing the <literal>+</literal> sign. Example</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:http-server-dsl:+:stubs:8080"})</programlisting>
<simpara>If the versioning however is fixed (e.g. <literal>1.0.4.RELEASE</literal> or <literal>2.1.1</literal>) then you have to set the concrete value of the jar
version. Example for 2.1.1.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:http-server-dsl:2.1.1:stubs:8080"})</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_dev_or_prod_stubs">
<title>Dev or prod stubs</title>
<simpara>You can manipulate the classifier to run the tests against current development version of the stubs of other services
 or the ones that were deployed to production. If you alter your build to deploy the stubs with the <literal>prod-stubs</literal> classifier
 once you reach production deployment then you can run tests in one case with dev stubs and one with prod stubs.</simpara>
<simpara>Example of tests using development version of stubs</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:http-server-dsl:+:stubs:8080"})</programlisting>
<simpara>Example of tests using production version of stubs</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:http-server-dsl:+:prod-stubs:8080"})</programlisting>
<simpara>You can pass those values also via properties from your deployment pipeline.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="_common_repo_with_contracts">
<title>Common repo with contracts</title>
<simpara>Another way of storing contracts other than having them with the producer is keeping them in a common place.
It can be related to security issues where the consumers can&#8217;t clone the producer&#8217;s code. Also if you keep
contracts in a single place then you, as a producer, will know how many consumers you have and which
consumer will you break with your local changes.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_repo_structure">
<title>Repo structure</title>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s assume that we have a producer with coordinates <literal>com.example:server</literal> and 3 consumers: <literal>client1</literal>,
<literal>client2</literal>, <literal>client3</literal>. Then in the repository with common contracts you would have the following setup
(which you can checkout <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/tree/1.0.x/samples/standalone/contracts">here</link>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">├── com

        └── contracts.xml</programlisting>
<simpara>As you can see the under the slash-delimited groupid <literal>/</literal> artifact id folder (<literal>com/example/server</literal>) you have
expectations of the 3 consumers (<literal>client1</literal>, <literal>client2</literal> and <literal>client3</literal>). Expectations are the standard Groovy DSL
contract files as described throughout this documentation. This repository has to produce a JAR file that maps
one to one to the contents of the repo.</simpara>

<simpara>As you can see there are no dependencies other than the Spring Cloud Contract Maven Plugin.
Those poms are necessary for the consumer side to run <literal>mvn clean install -DskipTests</literal> to locally install
 stubs of the producer project.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>pom.xml</literal> in the root folder can look like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

	&lt;artifactId&gt;contracts&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;version&gt;0.0.1-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;

	&lt;name&gt;Contracts&lt;/name&gt;
	&lt;description&gt;Contains all the Spring Cloud Contracts, well, contracts. JAR used by the producers to generate tests and stubs&lt;/description&gt;

	&lt;properties&gt;
		&lt;project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;UTF-8&lt;/project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;
	&lt;/properties&gt;

&lt;/project&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>It&#8217;s using the assembly plugin in order to build the JAR with all the contracts. Example of such setup is here:</simpara>

<section xml:id="_workflow">
<title>Workflow</title>
<simpara>The workflow would look similar to the one presented in the <literal>Step by step guide to CDC</literal>. The only difference
 is that the producer doesn&#8217;t own the contracts anymore. So the consumer and the producer have to work on
 common contracts in a common repository.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_consumer">
<title>Consumer</title>
<simpara>When the <emphasis role="strong">consumer</emphasis> wants to work on the contracts offline, instead of cloning the producer code, the
consumer team clones the common repository, goes to the required producer&#8217;s folder (e.g. <literal>com/example/server</literal>)
and runs <literal>mvn clean install -DskipTests</literal> to install locally the stubs converted from the contracts.</simpara>
<tip>

</tip>
</section>
<section xml:id="_producer">
<title>Producer</title>
<simpara>As a <emphasis role="strong">producer</emphasis> it&#8217;s enough to alter the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier to provide the URL and the dependency
of the JAR containing the contracts:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;plugin&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;

		&lt;contractDependency&gt;
			&lt;groupId&gt;com.example.standalone&lt;/groupId&gt;
			&lt;artifactId&gt;contracts&lt;/artifactId&gt;
		&lt;/contractDependency&gt;
	&lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>With this setup the JAR with groupid <literal>com.example.standalone</literal> and artifactid <literal>contracts</literal> will be downloaded
from <literal><link xl:href="http://link/to/your/nexus/or/artifactory/or/sth">http://link/to/your/nexus/or/artifactory/or/sth</link></literal>. It will be then unpacked in a local temporary folder
and contracts present under the <literal>com/example/server</literal> will be picked as the ones used to generate the
tests and the stubs. Due to this convention the producer team will know which consumer teams will be broken
when some incompatible changes are done.</simpara>
<simpara>The rest of the flow looks the same.</simpara>

<simpara>The generated tests all boil down to RestAssured in some form or fashion which relies on <link xl:href="https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/">Apache HttpClient</link>.  HttpClient has a facility called <link xl:href="https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/logging.html#Wire_Logging">wire logging</link> which logs the entire request and response to HttpClient.  Spring Boot has a logging <link xl:href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/common-application-properties.html">common application property</link> for doing this sort of thing, just add this to your application properties</simpara>

<simpara>Yes! With version 1.1.0 we&#8217;ve added such a possibility. On the HTTP stub server side we&#8217;re providing support

<section xml:id="_can_i_reference_text_from_file">
<title>Can I reference text from file?</title>
<simpara>Yes! With version 1.2.0 we&#8217;ve added such a possibility. It&#8217;s enough to call <literal>file(&#8230;&#8203;)</literal> method in the
DSL and provide a path relative to where the contract lays.
If you&#8217;re using YAML just use the <literal>bodyFromFile</literal> property.</simpara>

<simpara>By default, Spring Cloud Contract Verifier is looking for stubs in the
<literal>src/test/resources/contracts</literal> directory.</simpara>
<simpara>The directory containing stub definitions is treated as a class name, and each stub
definition is treated as a single test. Spring Cloud Contract Verifier assumes that it
contains at  least one level of directories that are to be used as the test class name.
If more than  one level of nested directories is present, all except the last one is used
as the package name. For example, with following structure:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">src/test/resources/contracts/myservice/shouldCreateUser.groovy
src/test/resources/contracts/myservice/shouldReturnUser.groovy</programlisting>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier creates a test class named <literal>defaultBasePackage.MyService</literal>

<section xml:id="gradle-different-base-classes">
<title>Different Base Classes for Contracts</title>
<simpara>If your base classes differ between contracts, you can tell the Spring Cloud Contract
plugin which class should get extended by the autogenerated tests. You have two options:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Follow a convention by providing the <literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Provide explicit mapping via <literal>baseClassMappings</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">By Convention</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>The convention is such that if you have a contract under (for example)
<literal>src/test/resources/contract/foo/bar/baz/</literal> and set the value of the
<literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal> property to <literal>com.example.base</literal>, then Spring Cloud Contract
Verifier assumes that there is a <literal>BarBazBase</literal> class under the <literal>com.example.base</literal> package.
In other words, the system takes the last two parts of the package, if they exist, and
forms a class with a <literal>Base</literal> suffix. This rule takes precedence over <emphasis role="strong">baseClassForTests</emphasis>.
Here is an example of how it works in the <literal>contracts</literal> closure:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">packageWithBaseClasses = 'com.example.base'</programlisting>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">By Mapping</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>You can manually map a regular expression of the contract&#8217;s package to fully qualified
name of the base class for the matched contract. You have to provide a list called

baseClassMappings {
	baseClassMapping('.*/com/.*', 'com.example.ComBase')
	baseClassMapping('.*/bar/.*':'com.example.BarBase')
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s assume that you have contracts under
 - <literal>src/test/resources/contract/com/</literal>
 - <literal>src/test/resources/contract/foo/</literal></simpara>
<simpara>By providing the <literal>baseClassForTests</literal>, we have a fallback in case mapping did not succeed.
(You could also provide the <literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal> as a fallback.) That way, the tests
generated from <literal>src/test/resources/contract/com/</literal> contracts extend the
<literal>com.example.ComBase</literal>, whereas the rest of the tests extend <literal>com.example.FooBase</literal>.</simpara>

than one level of nested directories, all except the last one is used as package name.

</section>
<section xml:id="maven-different-base">
<title>Different base classes for contracts</title>
<simpara>If your base classes differ between contracts, you can tell the Spring Cloud Contract
plugin which class should get extended by the autogenerated tests. You have two options:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Follow a convention by providing the <literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>provide explicit mapping via <literal>baseClassMappings</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">By Convention</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>The convention is such that if you have a contract under (for example)
<literal>src/test/resources/contract/foo/bar/baz/</literal> and set the value of the
<literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal> property to <literal>com.example.base</literal>, then Spring Cloud Contract
Verifier assumes that there is a <literal>BarBazBase</literal> class under the <literal>com.example.base</literal> package.
In other words, the system takes the last two parts of the package, if they exist, and
forms a class with a <literal>Base</literal> suffix. This rule takes precedence over <emphasis role="strong">baseClassForTests</emphasis>.
Here is an example of how it works in the <literal>contracts</literal> closure:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;plugin&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;configuration&gt;
		&lt;packageWithBaseClasses&gt;hello&lt;/packageWithBaseClasses&gt;
	&lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">By Mapping</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>You can manually map a regular expression of the contract&#8217;s package to fully qualified
name of the base class for the matched contract. You have to provide a list called
<literal>baseClassMappings</literal> that consists <literal>baseClassMapping</literal> objects that takes a
<literal>contractPackageRegex</literal> to <literal>baseClassFQN</literal> mapping. Consider the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;plugin&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;configuration&gt;
		&lt;baseClassForTests&gt;com.example.FooBase&lt;/baseClassForTests&gt;
		&lt;baseClassMappings&gt;
			&lt;baseClassMapping&gt;
				&lt;contractPackageRegex&gt;.*com.*&lt;/contractPackageRegex&gt;
				&lt;baseClassFQN&gt;com.example.TestBase&lt;/baseClassFQN&gt;
			&lt;/baseClassMapping&gt;
		&lt;/baseClassMappings&gt;
	&lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Assume that you have contracts under these two locations:
* <literal>src/test/resources/contract/com/</literal>
* <literal>src/test/resources/contract/foo/</literal></simpara>
<simpara>By providing the <literal>baseClassForTests</literal>, we have a fallback in case mapping did not succeed.
(You can also provide the <literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal> as a fallback.) That way, the tests
generated from <literal>src/test/resources/contract/com/</literal> contracts extend the
<literal>com.example.ComBase</literal>, whereas the rest of the tests extend <literal>com.example.FooBase</literal>.</simpara>

<title>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier on the Consumer Side</title>
<simpara>You can also use the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier for the consumer side. To do so, use
the plugin so that it only converts the contracts and generates the stubs. To achieve
that, you need to configure Spring Cloud Contract Verifier plugin in exactly the same way
as you would for a provider. You need to copy contracts stored in
<literal>src/test/resources/contracts</literal> and generate WireMock JSON stubs using the
<literal>mvn generateStubs</literal> command. By default, the generated WireMock mapping is stored in a
directory named <literal>target/mappings</literal>. From these generated mappings, your project should
create additional artifacts with a classifier of <literal>stubs</literal> for easy deployment to the maven
repository.</simpara>
<simpara>Here is a sample configuration:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;plugin&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;${verifier-plugin.version}&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;executions&gt;
        &lt;execution&gt;
            &lt;goals&gt;
                &lt;goal&gt;convert&lt;/goal&gt;
                &lt;goal&gt;generateStubs&lt;/goal&gt;
            &lt;/goals&gt;
        &lt;/execution&gt;
    &lt;/executions&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>When present, JSON stubs can be used in consumer automated tests, as shown here:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringTestRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureStubRunner
public class LoanApplicationServiceTests {

  @Autowired
  LoanApplicationService service;

  @Test
  public void shouldSuccessfullyApplyForLoan() {
    //given:
 	LoanApplication application =
			new LoanApplication(new Client("12345678901"), 123.123);
    //when:
	LoanApplicationResult loanApplication = service.loanApplication(application);
    // then:
	assertThat(loanApplication.loanApplicationStatus).isEqualTo(LoanApplicationStatus.LOAN_APPLIED);
	assertThat(loanApplication.rejectionReason).isNull();
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara><literal>LoanApplication</literal> makes a call to the <literal>FraudDetection</literal> service. This request is handled
by a WireMock server configured with stubs generated by the Spring Cloud Contract
Verifier.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_stubs_and_transitive_dependencies">
<title>Stubs and Transitive Dependencies</title>
<simpara>The Maven and Gradle plugin that add the tasks that create the stubs jar for you. One
problem that arises is that, when reusing the stubs, you can mistakenly import all of
that stub&#8217;s dependencies. When building a Maven artifact, even though you have a couple
of different jars, all of them share one pom:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-20160903.075506-1-stubs.jar

<simpara>There are three possibilities of working with those dependencies so as not to have any
issues with transitive dependencies:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Mark all application dependencies as optional</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Create a separate artifactid for the stubs</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Exclude dependencies on the consumer side</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Mark all application dependencies as optional</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>If, in the <literal>github-webhook</literal> application, you mark all of your dependencies as optional,
when you include the <literal>github-webhook</literal> stubs in another application (or when that
dependency gets downloaded by Stub Runner) then, since all of the dependencies are
optional, they will not get downloaded.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Create a separate <literal>artifactid</literal> for the stubs</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>If you create a separate <literal>artifactid</literal>, then you can set it up in whatever way you wish.
For example, you might decide to have no dependencies at all.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Exclude dependencies on the consumer side</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>As a consumer, if you add the stub dependency to your classpath, you can explicitly
exclude the unwanted dependencies.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_scenarios">
<title>Scenarios</title>
<simpara>You can handle scenarios with Spring Cloud Contract Verifier. All you need to do is to
stick to the proper naming convention while creating your contracts. The convention
requires including an order number followed by an underscore. This will work regardles
 of whether you&#8217;re working with YAML or Groovy. Example:</simpara>
<screen>my_contracts_dir\
  scenario1\
    1_login.groovy
    2_showCart.groovy
    3_logout.groovy</screen>
<simpara>Such a tree causes Spring Cloud Contract Verifier to generate WireMock&#8217;s scenario with a
name of <literal>scenario1</literal> and the three following steps:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>login marked as <literal>Started</literal> pointing to&#8230;&#8203;</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>showCart marked as <literal>Step1</literal> pointing to&#8230;&#8203;</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>logout marked as <literal>Step2</literal> which will close the scenario.</simpara>

<simpara>The <literal>EXPLICIT</literal> mode means that the tests generated from contracts will send

<section xml:id="_short_intro_to_maven_jars_and_binary_storage">
<title>Short intro to Maven, JARs and Binary storage</title>
<simpara>Since the Docker image can be used by non JVM projects, it&#8217;s good to
explain the basic terms behind Spring Cloud Contract packaging defaults.</simpara>
<simpara>Part of the following definitions were taken from the <link xl:href="https://maven.apache.org/glossary.html">Maven Glossary</link></simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>Project</literal>: Maven thinks in terms of projects. Everything that you
will build are projects. Those projects follow a well defined
“Project Object Model”. Projects can depend on other projects,
in which case the latter are called “dependencies”. A project may
consistent of several subprojects, however these subprojects are still
treated equally as projects.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>Artifact</literal>: An artifact is something that is either produced or used
by a project. Examples of artifacts produced by Maven for a project
include: JARs, source and binary distributions. Each artifact
is uniquely identified by a group id and an artifact ID which is
unique within a group.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>JAR</literal>: JAR stands for Java ARchive. It&#8217;s a format based on
the ZIP file format. Spring Cloud Contract packages the contracts and generated
stubs in a JAR file.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>GroupId</literal>: A group ID is a universally unique identifier for a project.
While this is often just the project name (eg. commons-collections),
it is helpful to use a fully-qualified package name to distinguish it
from other projects with a similar name (eg. org.apache.maven).
Typically, when published to the Artifact Manager, the <literal>GroupId</literal> will get
slash separated and form part of the URL. E.g. for group id <literal>com.example</literal>
and artifact id <literal>application</literal> would be <literal>/com/example/application/</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>Classifier</literal>: The Maven dependency notation looks as follows:
<literal>groupId:artifactId:version:classifier</literal>. The classifier is additional suffix
passed to the dependency. E.g. <literal>stubs</literal>, <literal>sources</literal>. The same dependency
e.g. <literal>com.example:application</literal> can produce multiple artifacts that
differ from each other with the classifier.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>Artifact manager</literal>: When you generate binaries / sources / packages, you would
like them to be available for others to download / reference or reuse. In case
of the JVM world those artifacts would be JARs, for Ruby these are gems
and for Docker those would be Docker images. You can store those artifacts
in a manager. Examples of such managers can be <link xl:href="https://jfrog.com/artifactory/">Artifactory</link>
or <link xl:href="http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/">Nexus</link>.</simpara>

<simpara>One of the issues that you might encounter while using Spring Cloud Contract Verifier is
passing the generated WireMock JSON stubs from the server side to the client side (or to
various clients). The same takes place in terms of client-side generation for messaging.</simpara>
<simpara>Copying the JSON files and setting the client side for messaging manually is out of the
question. That is why we introduced Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner. It can
automatically download and run the stubs for you.</simpara>

<title>Stub Runner Boot with Service Discovery</title>
<simpara>One of the possibilities of using Stub Runner Boot is to use it as a feed of stubs for "smoke-tests". What does it mean?
 Let&#8217;s assume that you don&#8217;t want to deploy 50 microservice to a test environment in order
 to check if your application is working fine. You&#8217;ve already executed a suite of tests during the build process
 but you would also like to ensure that the packaging of your application is fine. What you can do
 is to deploy your application to an environment, start it and run a couple of tests on it to see if
 it&#8217;s working fine. We can call those tests smoke-tests since their idea is to check only a handful
 of testing scenarios.</simpara>
<simpara>The problem with this approach is such that if you&#8217;re doing microservices most likely you&#8217;re
 using a service discovery tool. Stub Runner Boot allows you to solve this issue by starting the
 required stubs and register them in a service discovery tool. Let&#8217;s take a look at an example of
 such a setup with Eureka. Let&#8217;s assume that Eureka was already running.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@EnableStubRunnerServer
@EnableEurekaClient
@AutoConfigureStubRunner
public class StubRunnerBootEurekaExample {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(StubRunnerBootEurekaExample.class, args);
	}

}</programlisting>
<simpara>As you can see we want to start a Stub Runner Boot server <literal>@EnableStubRunnerServer</literal>, enable Eureka client <literal>@EnableEurekaClient</literal>
and we want to have the stub runner feature turned on <literal>@AutoConfigureStubRunner</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Now let&#8217;s assume that we want to start this application so that the stubs get automatically registered.
 We can do it by running the app <literal>java -jar ${SYSTEM_PROPS} stub-runner-boot-eureka-example.jar</literal> where
 <literal>${SYSTEM_PROPS}</literal> would contain the following list of properties</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">-Dstubrunner.repositoryRoot=http://repo.spring.io/snapshots (1)
-Dstubrunner.cloud.stubbed.discovery.enabled=false (2)
-Dstubrunner.ids=org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.stubs:loanIssuance,org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.stubs:fraudDetectionServer,org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.stubs:bootService (3)
-Dstubrunner.idsToServiceIds.fraudDetectionServer=someNameThatShouldMapFraudDetectionServer (4)

(1) - we tell Stub Runner where all the stubs reside
(2) - we don't want the default behaviour where the discovery service is stubbed. That's why the stub registration will be picked
(3) - we provide a list of stubs to download
(4) - we provide a list of artifactId to serviceId mapping</programlisting>
<simpara>That way your deployed application can send requests to started WireMock servers via the service
discovery. Most likely points 1-3 could be set by default in <literal>application.yml</literal> cause they are not
likely to change. That way you can provide only the list of stubs to download whenever you start
the Stub Runner Boot.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_stubs_per_consumer">
<title>Stubs Per Consumer</title>
<simpara>There are cases in which 2 consumers of the same endpoint want to have 2 different responses.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>This approach also allows you to immediately know which consumer is using which part of your API.
You can remove part of a response that your API produces and you can see which of your autogenerated tests
fails. If none fails then you can safely delete that part of the response cause nobody is using it.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s look at the following example for contract defined for the producer called <literal>producer</literal>.
There are 2 consumers: <literal>foo-consumer</literal> and <literal>bar-consumer</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Consumer <literal>foo-service</literal></emphasis></simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">request {
   url '/foo'
   method GET()
}
response {
    status 200
    body(
       foo: "foo"
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Consumer <literal>bar-service</literal></emphasis></simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">request {
   url '/foo'
   method GET()
}
response {
    status 200
    body(
       bar: "bar"
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>You can&#8217;t produce for the same request 2 different responses. That&#8217;s why you can properly package the
contracts and then profit from the <literal>stubsPerConsumer</literal> feature.</simpara>
<simpara>On the producer side the consumers can have a folder that contains contracts related only to them.
By setting the <literal>stubrunner.stubs-per-consumer</literal> flag to <literal>true</literal> we no longer register all stubs but only those that
correspond to the consumer application&#8217;s name. In other words we&#8217;ll scan the path of every stub and
if it contains the subfolder with name of the consumer in the path only then will it get registered.</simpara>
<simpara>On the <literal>foo</literal> producer side the contracts would look like this</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">.
└── contracts
    ├── bar-consumer
    │   ├── bookReturnedForBar.groovy
    │   └── shouldCallBar.groovy
    └── foo-consumer
        ├── bookReturnedForFoo.groovy
        └── shouldCallFoo.groovy</programlisting>
<simpara>Being the <literal>bar-consumer</literal> consumer you can either set the <literal>spring.application.name</literal> or the <literal>stubrunner.consumer-name</literal> to <literal>bar-consumer</literal>
Or set the test as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">@ContextConfiguration(classes = Config, loader = SpringBootContextLoader)
@SpringBootTest(properties = ["spring.application.name=bar-consumer"])
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = "org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.stubs:producerWithMultipleConsumers",
		repositoryRoot = "classpath:m2repo/repository/",
		stubsPerConsumer = true)
@DirtiesContext
class StubRunnerStubsPerConsumerSpec extends Specification {
...
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Then only the stubs registered under a path that contains the <literal>bar-consumer</literal> in its name (i.e. those from the
<literal>src/test/resources/contracts/bar-consumer/some/contracts/&#8230;&#8203;</literal> folder) will be allowed to be referenced.</simpara>
<simpara>Or set the consumer name explicitly</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">@ContextConfiguration(classes = Config, loader = SpringBootContextLoader)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = "org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.stubs:producerWithMultipleConsumers",
		repositoryRoot = "classpath:m2repo/repository/",
		consumerName = "foo-consumer",
		stubsPerConsumer = true)
@DirtiesContext
class StubRunnerStubsPerConsumerWithConsumerNameSpec extends Specification {
...
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Then only the stubs registered under a path that contains the <literal>foo-consumer</literal> in its name (i.e. those from the
<literal>src/test/resources/contracts/foo-consumer/some/contracts/&#8230;&#8203;</literal> folder) will be allowed to be referenced.</simpara>

<title>Stub Runner Spring AMQP</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier Stub Runner&#8217;s messaging module provides an easy way to
integrate with Spring AMQP&#8217;s Rabbit Template. For the provided artifacts, it
automatically downloads the stubs and registers the required routes.</simpara>
<simpara>The integration tries to work standalone (that is, without interaction with a running
RabbitMQ message broker). It expects a <literal>RabbitTemplate</literal> on the application context and
uses it as a spring boot test named <literal>@SpyBean</literal>. As a result, it can use the mockito spy
functionality to verify and inspect messages sent by the application.</simpara>
<simpara>On the message consumer side, the stub runner considers all <literal>@RabbitListener</literal> annotated
endpoints and all <literal>SimpleMessageListenerContainer</literal> objects on the application context.</simpara>
<simpara>As messages are usually sent to exchanges in AMQP, the message contract contains the
exchange name as the destination. Message listeners on the other side are bound to
queues. Bindings connect an exchange to a queue. If message contracts are triggered, the
Spring AMQP stub runner integration looks for bindings on the application context that
match this exchange. Then it collects the queues from the Spring exchanges and tries to
find message listeners bound to these queues. The message is triggered for all matching
message listeners.</simpara>

<literal>org.springframework.cloud.spec.Contract.make { &#8230;&#8203; }</literal>. You can also provide an import to

<title>Limitations</title>
<warning>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier does not properly support XML. Please use JSON or
help us implement this feature.</simpara>
</warning>
<warning>
<simpara>The support for verifying the size of JSON arrays is experimental. If you want
to turn it on, please set the value of the following system property to <literal>true</literal>:
<literal>spring.cloud.contract.verifier.assert.size</literal>. By default, this feature is set to <literal>false</literal>.
You can also provide the <literal>assertJsonSize</literal> property in the plugin configuration.</simpara>
</warning>
<warning>
<simpara>Because JSON structure can have any form, it can be impossible to parse it
properly when using the Groovy DSL and the <literal>value(consumer(&#8230;&#8203;), producer(&#8230;&#8203;))</literal> notation in <literal>GString</literal>. That

<section xml:id="_dynamic_properties">
<title>Dynamic properties</title>
<simpara>The contract can contain some dynamic properties: timestamps, IDs, and so on. You do not
want to force the consumers to stub their clocks to always return the same value of time
so that it gets matched by the stub.</simpara>
<simpara>For Groovy DSL you can provide the dynamic parts in your contracts
in two ways: pass them directly in the body or set them in separate sections called
<literal>testMatchers</literal> and <literal>stubMatchers</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>For YAML you can only use the <literal>matchers</literal> section.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_dynamic_properties_inside_the_body">
<title>Dynamic properties inside the body</title>
<important>
<simpara>This section is valid only for Groovy DSL. Check out the
<xref linkend="contract-matchers"/> section for YAML examples of a similar feature.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>You can set the properties inside the body either with the <literal>value</literal> method or, if you use
the Groovy map notation, with <literal>$()</literal>. The following example shows how to set dynamic
properties with the value method:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">value(consumer(...), producer(...))
value(c(...), p(...))
value(stub(...), test(...))
value(client(...), server(...))</programlisting>
<simpara>The following example shows how to set dynamic properties with <literal>$()</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">$(consumer(...), producer(...))
$(c(...), p(...))
$(stub(...), test(...))
$(client(...), server(...))</programlisting>
<simpara>Both approaches work equally well. <literal>stub</literal> and <literal>client</literal> methods are aliases over the <literal>consumer</literal>
method. Subsequent sections take a closer look at what you can do with those values.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_regular_expressions">
<title>Regular expressions</title>
<important>
<simpara>This section is valid only for Groovy DSL. Check out the
<xref linkend="contract-matchers"/> section for YAML examples of a similar feature.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>You can use regular expressions to write your requests in Contract DSL. Doing so is
particularly useful when you want to indicate that a given response should be provided
for requests that follow a given pattern. Also, you can use regular expressions when you
need to use patterns and not exact values both for your test and your server side tests.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows how to use regular expressions to write a request:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
	request {
		method('GET')
		url $(consumer(~/\/[0-9]{2}/), producer('/12'))
	}
	response {
		status 200
		body(
				id: $(anyNumber()),
				surname: $(
						consumer('Kowalsky'),
						producer(regex('[a-zA-Z]+'))
				),
				name: 'Jan',
				created: $(consumer('2014-02-02 12:23:43'), producer(execute('currentDate(it)'))),
				correlationId: value(consumer('5d1f9fef-e0dc-4f3d-a7e4-72d2220dd827'),
						producer(regex('[a-fA-F0-9]{8}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{12}'))
				)
		)
		headers {
			header 'Content-Type': 'text/plain'
		}
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>You can also provide only one side of the communication with a regular expression. If you
do so, then the contract engine automatically provides the generated string that matches
the provided regular expression. The following code shows an example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
	request {
		method 'PUT'
		url value(consumer(regex('/foo/[0-9]{5}')))
		body([
			requestElement: $(consumer(regex('[0-9]{5}')))
		])
		headers {
			header('header', $(consumer(regex('application\\/vnd\\.fraud\\.v1\\+json;.*'))))
		}
	}
	response {
		status 200
		body([
			responseElement: $(producer(regex('[0-9]{7}')))
		])
		headers {
			contentType("application/vnd.fraud.v1+json")
		}
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In the preceding example, the opposite side of the communication has the respective data
generated for request and response.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract comes with a series of predefined regular expressions that you can
use in your contracts, as shown in the following example:</simpara>

<important>
<simpara>This section is valid only for Groovy DSL. Check out the
<xref linkend="contract-matchers"/> section for YAML examples of a similar feature.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>It is possible to provide optional parameters in your contract. However, you can provide
optional parameters only for the following:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis>STUB</emphasis> side of the Request</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis>TEST</emphasis> side of the Response</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The following example shows how to provide optional parameters:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
	priority 1
	request {
		method 'POST'
		url '/users/password'

	}
	response {
		status 404
		headers {
			header 'Content-Type': 'application/json'
		}
		body(
				code: value(consumer("123123"), producer(optional("123123")))
		)
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>By wrapping a part of the body with the <literal>optional()</literal> method, you create a regular
expression that must be present 0 or more times.</simpara>
<simpara>If you use Spock for, the following test would be generated from the previous example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">"""
 given:
  def request = given()
    .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
    .body('''{"email":"abc@abc.com","callback_url":"http://partners.com"}''')

 when:
  def response = given().spec(request)
    .post("/users/password")

 then:
  response.statusCode == 404
  response.header('Content-Type')  == 'application/json'
 and:
  DocumentContext parsedJson = JsonPath.parse(response.body.asString())
  assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("['code']").matches("(123123)?")
"""</programlisting>
<simpara>The following stub would also be generated:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">'''

  "request" : {

<important>
<simpara>This section is valid only for Groovy DSL. Check out the

</important>
<simpara>You can define a method call that executes on the server side during the test. Such a
method can be added to the class defined as "baseClassForTests" in the configuration. The
following code shows an example of the contract portion of the test case:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
	request {
		method 'PUT'
		url $(consumer(regex('^/api/[0-9]{2}$')), producer('/api/12'))

		}
		body '''\
				[{
					"text": "Gonna see you at Warsaw"
				}]
			'''
	}
	response {
		body (
				path: $(consumer('/api/12'), producer(regex('^/api/[0-9]{2}$'))),
				correlationId: $(consumer('1223456'), producer(execute('isProperCorrelationId($it)')))
		)
		status 200
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The following code shows the base class portion of the test case:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">abstract class BaseMockMvcSpec extends Specification {

	def setup() {
		RestAssuredMockMvc.standaloneSetup(new PairIdController())
	}

	void isProperCorrelationId(Integer correlationId) {
		assert correlationId == 123456
	}

	void isEmpty(String value) {
		assert value == null
	}

}</programlisting>
<important>
<simpara>You cannot use both a String and <literal>execute</literal> to perform concatenation. For
example, calling <literal>header('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + execute('authToken()'))</literal> leads to
improper results. Instead, call <literal>header('Authorization', execute('authToken()'))</literal> and
ensure that the <literal>authToken()</literal> method returns everything you need.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>The type of the object read from the JSON can be one of the following, depending on the
JSON path:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>String</literal>: If you point to a <literal>String</literal> value in the JSON.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>JSONArray</literal>: If you point to a <literal>List</literal> in the JSON.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>Map</literal>: If you point to a <literal>Map</literal> in the JSON.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>Number</literal>: If you point to <literal>Integer</literal>, <literal>Double</literal> etc. in the JSON.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>Boolean</literal>: If you point to a <literal>Boolean</literal> in the JSON.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>In the request part of the contract, you can specify that the <literal>body</literal> should be taken from
a method.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>You must provide both the consumer and the producer side. The <literal>execute</literal> part
is applied for the whole body - not for parts of it.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>The following example shows how to read an object from JSON:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">Contract contractDsl = Contract.make {
	request {

		url '/something'
		body(
				$(c("foo"), p(execute("hashCode()")))
		)
	}
	response {
		status 200
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The preceding example results in calling the <literal>hashCode()</literal> method in the request body.
It should resemble the following code:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// given:
 MockMvcRequestSpecification request = given()
   .body(hashCode());

// when:

<simpara>This feature works only with WireMock having a version greater than or equal
to 2.5.1. The Spring Cloud Contract Verifier uses WireMock&#8217;s
<literal>response-template</literal> response transformer. It uses Handlebars to convert the Mustache <literal>{{{ }}}</literal> templates into
proper values. Additionally, it registers two helper functions:</simpara>

<title>Registering Your Own WireMock Extension</title>
<simpara>WireMock lets you register custom extensions. By default, Spring Cloud Contract registers
the transformer, which lets you reference a request from a response. If you want to
provide your own extensions, you can register an implementation of the
<literal>org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.dsl.wiremock.WireMockExtensions</literal> interface.
Since we use the spring.factories extension approach, you can create an entry in
<literal>META-INF/spring.factories</literal> file similar to the following:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.dsl.wiremock.WireMockExtensions=\
org.springframework.cloud.contract.stubrunner.provider.wiremock.TestWireMockExtensions</programlisting>
<simpara>The following is an example of a custom extension:</simpara>

<simpara>Remember to override the <literal>applyGlobally()</literal> method and set it to <literal>false</literal> if you
want the transformation to be applied only for a mapping that explicitly requires it.</simpara>

<title>Dynamic Properties in the Matchers Sections</title>
<simpara>If you work with <link xl:href="https://docs.pact.io/">Pact</link>, the following discussion may seem familiar.
Quite a few users are used to having a separation between the body and setting the
dynamic parts of a contract.</simpara>
<simpara>You can use two separate sections:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>stubMatchers</literal>, which lets you define the dynamic values that should end up in a stub.
You can set it in the <literal>request</literal> or <literal>inputMessage</literal> part of your contract.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>testMatchers</literal>, which is present in the <literal>response</literal> or <literal>outputMessage</literal> side of the
contract.</simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara><literal>byType()</literal>: The value taken from the response via the provided JSON Path needs to be
of the same type as the type defined in the body of the response in the contract.
<literal>byType</literal> can take a closure, in which you can set <literal>minOccurrence</literal> and <literal>maxOccurrence</literal>.
That way, you can assert the size of the flattened collection. To check the size of an
unflattened collection, use a custom method with the <literal>byCommand(&#8230;&#8203;)</literal> testMatcher.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>byCommand(&#8230;&#8203;)</literal>: The value taken from the response via the provided JSON Path is
passed as an input to the custom method that you provide. For example,
<literal>byCommand('foo($it)')</literal> results in calling a <literal>foo</literal> method to which the value matching the
JSON Path gets passed. The type of the object read from the JSON can be one of the

<simpara>In the preceding example, you can see the dynamic portions of the contract in the
<literal>matchers</literal> sections. For the request part, you can see that, for all fields but
<literal>valueWithoutAMatcher</literal>, the values of the regular expressions that the stub should
contain are explicitly set. For the <literal>valueWithoutAMatcher</literal>, the verification takes place
in the same way as without the use of matchers. In that case, the test performs an
equality check.</simpara>
<simpara>For the response side in the <literal>testMatchers</literal> section, we define the dynamic parts in a
similar manner. The only difference is that the <literal>byType</literal> matchers are also present. The
verifier engine checks four fields to verify whether the response from the test
has a value for which the JSON path matches the given field, is of the same type as the one
defined in the response body, and passes the following check (based on the method being called):</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>For <literal>$.valueWithTypeMatch</literal>, the engine checks whether the type is the same.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<simpara>In the preceding example, one contract has the <literal>name</literal> field and the other does not. This

}</programlisting>
<simpara>Notice that, for the contract that has the <literal>name</literal> field, the generated test method is named
<literal>validate_should_post_a_user</literal>. For the one that does not have the name, it is called
<literal>validate_withList_1</literal>. It corresponds to the name of the file <literal>WithList.groovy</literal> and the
index of the contract in the list.</simpara>
<simpara>The generated stubs is shown in the following example:</simpara>
<screen>should post a user.json
1_WithList.json</screen>
<simpara>As you can see, the first file got the <literal>name</literal> parameter from the contract. The second
got the name of the contract file (<literal>WithList.groovy</literal>) prefixed with the index (in this
case, the contract had an index of <literal>1</literal> in the list of contracts in the file).</simpara>

your tests far more meaningful.</simpara>

<simpara>You may encounter cases where you have your contracts have been defined in other formats,
such as YAML, RAML or PACT. In those cases, you still want to benefit from the automatic
generation of tests and stubs. You can add your own implementation for generating both
tests and stubs. Also, you can customize the way tests are generated (for example, you
can generate tests for other languages) and the way stubs are generated (for example, you
can generate stubs for other HTTP server implementations).</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_spring_cloud_contract_wiremock">
<title>Spring Cloud Contract WireMock</title>
<simpara>The Spring Cloud Contract WireMock modules let you use <link xl:href="http://wiremock.org">WireMock</link> in a
Spring Boot application. Check out the
<link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/tree/master/samples">samples</link>
for more details.</simpara>
<simpara>If you have a Spring Boot application that uses Tomcat as an embedded server (which is
the default with <literal>spring-boot-starter-web</literal>),  you can add
<literal>spring-cloud-contract-wiremock</literal> to your classpath and add <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal> in
order to be able to use Wiremock in your tests. Wiremock runs as a stub server and you
can register stub behavior using a Java API or via static JSON declarations as part of
your test. The following code shows an example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@AutoConfigureWireMock(port = 0)
public class WiremockForDocsTests {
	// A service that calls out over HTTP
	@Autowired private Service service;

	// Using the WireMock APIs in the normal way:
	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		// Stubbing WireMock
		stubFor(get(urlEqualTo("/resource"))
				.willReturn(aResponse().withHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain").withBody("Hello World!")));
		// We're asserting if WireMock responded properly
		assertThat(this.service.go()).isEqualTo("Hello World!");
	}

}</programlisting>
<simpara>To start the stub server on a different port use (for example),
<literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock(port=9999)</literal>. For a random port, use a value of <literal>0</literal>. The stub
server port can be bound in the test application context with the "wiremock.server.port"
property. Using <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal> adds a bean of type <literal>WiremockConfiguration</literal> to
your test application context, where it will be cached in between methods and classes
having the same context, the same as for Spring integration tests.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_registering_stubs_automatically">
<title>Registering Stubs Automatically</title>
<simpara>If you use <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal>, it registers WireMock JSON stubs from the file
system or classpath (by default, from <literal>file:src/test/resources/mappings</literal>). You can
customize the locations using the <literal>stubs</literal> attribute in the annotation, which can be an
Ant-style resource pattern or a directory. In the case of a directory, <literal><emphasis role="strong">*/</emphasis>.json</literal> is
appended. The following code shows an example:</simpara>
<screen>@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureWireMock(stubs="classpath:/stubs")
public class WiremockImportApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private Service service;

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		assertThat(this.service.go()).isEqualTo("Hello World!");
	}

}</screen>
<note>
<simpara>Actually, WireMock always loads mappings from <literal>src/test/resources/mappings</literal> <emphasis role="strong">as
well as</emphasis> the custom locations in the stubs attribute. To change this behavior, you can
also specify a files root as described in the next section of this document.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_using_files_to_specify_the_stub_bodies">
<title>Using Files to Specify the Stub Bodies</title>
<simpara>WireMock can read response bodies from files on the classpath or the file system. In that
case, you can see in the JSON DSL that the response has a <literal>bodyFileName</literal> instead of a
(literal) <literal>body</literal>. The files are resolved relative to a root directory (by default,
<literal>src/test/resources/__files</literal>). To customize this location you can set the <literal>files</literal>
attribute in the <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal> annotation to the location of the parent
directory (in other words, <literal>__files</literal> is a subdirectory). You can use Spring resource
notation to refer to <literal>file:&#8230;&#8203;</literal> or <literal>classpath:&#8230;&#8203;</literal> locations. Generic URLs are not
supported. A list of values can be given, in which case WireMock resolves the first file
that exists when it needs to find a response body.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>When you configure the <literal>files</literal> root, it also affects the
automatic loading of stubs, because they come from the root location
in a subdirectory called "mappings". The value of <literal>files</literal> has no
effect on the stubs loaded explicitly from the <literal>stubs</literal> attribute.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_alternative_using_junit_rules">
<title>Alternative: Using JUnit Rules</title>
<simpara>For a more conventional WireMock experience, you can use JUnit <literal>@Rules</literal> to start and stop
the server. To do so, use the <literal>WireMockSpring</literal> convenience class to obtain an <literal>Options</literal>
instance, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
public class WiremockForDocsClassRuleTests {

	// Start WireMock on some dynamic port
	// for some reason `dynamicPort()` is not working properly
	@ClassRule
	public static WireMockClassRule wiremock = new WireMockClassRule(
			WireMockSpring.options().dynamicPort());
	// A service that calls out over HTTP to localhost:${wiremock.port}
	@Autowired
	private Service service;

	// Using the WireMock APIs in the normal way:
	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		// Stubbing WireMock
		wiremock.stubFor(get(urlEqualTo("/resource"))
				.willReturn(aResponse().withHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain").withBody("Hello World!")));
		// We're asserting if WireMock responded properly
		assertThat(this.service.go()).isEqualTo("Hello World!");
	}

}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>@ClassRule</literal> means that the server shuts down after all the methods in this class
have been run.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_relaxed_ssl_validation_for_rest_template">
<title>Relaxed SSL Validation for Rest Template</title>
<simpara>WireMock lets you stub a "secure" server with an "https" URL protocol. If your
application wants to contact that stub server in an integration test, it will find that
the SSL certificates are not valid (the usual problem with self-installed certificates).
The best option is often to re-configure the client to use "http". If that&#8217;s not an
option, you can ask Spring to configure an HTTP client that ignores SSL validation errors
(do so only for tests, of course).</simpara>
<simpara>To make this work with minimum fuss, you need to be using the Spring Boot
<literal>RestTemplateBuilder</literal> in your app, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public RestTemplate restTemplate(RestTemplateBuilder builder) {
	return builder.build();
}</programlisting>
<simpara>You need <literal>RestTemplateBuilder</literal> because the builder is passed through callbacks to
initialize it, so the SSL validation can be set up in the client at that point. This
happens automatically in your test if you are using the <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal>
annotation or the stub runner. If you use the JUnit <literal>@Rule</literal> approach, you need to add the
<literal>@AutoConfigureHttpClient</literal> annotation as well, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest("app.baseUrl=https://localhost:6443")
@AutoConfigureHttpClient
public class WiremockHttpsServerApplicationTests {

	@ClassRule
	public static WireMockClassRule wiremock = new WireMockClassRule(
			WireMockSpring.options().httpsPort(6443));
...
}</programlisting>
<simpara>If you are using <literal>spring-boot-starter-test</literal>, you have the Apache HTTP client on the
classpath and it is selected by the <literal>RestTemplateBuilder</literal> and configured to ignore SSL
errors. If you use the default <literal>java.net</literal> client, you do not need the annotation (but it
won&#8217;t do any harm). There is no support currently for other clients, but it may be added
in future releases.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_wiremock_and_spring_mvc_mocks">
<title>WireMock and Spring MVC Mocks</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract provides a convenience class that can load JSON WireMock stubs into
a Spring <literal>MockRestServiceServer</literal>. The following code shows an example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.NONE)
public class WiremockForDocsMockServerApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private RestTemplate restTemplate;

	@Autowired
	private Service service;

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		// will read stubs classpath
		MockRestServiceServer server = WireMockRestServiceServer.with(this.restTemplate)
				.baseUrl("http://example.org").stubs("classpath:/stubs/resource.json")
				.build();
		// We're asserting if WireMock responded properly
		assertThat(this.service.go()).isEqualTo("Hello World");
		server.verify();
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>baseUrl</literal> value is prepended to all mock calls, and the <literal>stubs()</literal> method takes a stub
path resource pattern as an argument. In the preceding example, the stub defined at
<literal>/stubs/resource.json</literal> is loaded into the mock server. If the <literal>RestTemplate</literal> is asked to
visit <literal><link xl:href="http://example.org/">http://example.org/</link></literal>, it gets the responses as being declared at that URL. More
than one stub pattern can be specified, and each one can be a directory (for a recursive
list of all ".json"), a fixed filename (as in the example above), or an Ant-style
pattern. The JSON format is the normal WireMock format, which you can read about in the
<link xl:href="http://wiremock.org/docs/stubbing/">WireMock website</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>Currently, the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier supports Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow as
Spring Boot embedded servers, and Wiremock itself has "native" support for a particular
version of Jetty (currently 9.2). To use the native Jetty, you need to add the native
Wiremock dependencies and exclude the Spring Boot container (if there is one).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_customization_of_wiremock_configuration">
<title>Customization of WireMock configuration</title>
<simpara>You can register a bean of <literal>org.springframework.cloud.contract.wiremock.WireMockConfigurationCustomizer</literal> type
in order to customize the WireMock configuration (e.g. add custom transformers).
Example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">		@Bean WireMockConfigurationCustomizer optionsCustomizer() {
			return new WireMockConfigurationCustomizer() {
				@Override public void customize(WireMockConfiguration options) {
// perform your customization here
				}
			};
		}</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_generating_stubs_using_rest_docs">
<title>Generating Stubs using REST Docs</title>
<simpara><link xl:href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-restdocs">Spring REST Docs</link> can be used to generate
documentation (for example in Asciidoctor format) for an HTTP API with Spring MockMvc or
Rest Assured. At the same time that you generate documentation for your API, you can also
generate WireMock stubs by using Spring Cloud Contract WireMock. To do so, write your
normal REST Docs test cases and use <literal>@AutoConfigureRestDocs</literal> to have stubs be
automatically generated in the REST Docs output directory. The following code shows an
example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureRestDocs(outputDir = "target/snippets")
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
public class ApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private MockMvc mockMvc;

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		mockMvc.perform(get("/resource"))
				.andExpect(content().string("Hello World"))
				.andDo(document("resource"));
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>This test generates a WireMock stub at "target/snippets/stubs/resource.json". It matches
all GET requests to the "/resource" path.</simpara>
<simpara>Without any additional configuration, this tests creates a stub with a request matcher
for the HTTP method and all headers except "host" and "content-length". To match the
request more precisely (for example, to match the body of a POST or PUT), we need to
explicitly create a request matcher. Doing so has two effects:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Creating a stub that matches only in the way you specify.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Asserting that the request in the test case also matches the same conditions.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The main entry point for this feature is <literal>WireMockRestDocs.verify()</literal>, which can be used
as a substitute for the <literal>document()</literal> convenience method, as shown in the following
example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureRestDocs(outputDir = "target/snippets")
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
public class ApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private MockMvc mockMvc;

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		mockMvc.perform(post("/resource")
                .content("{\"id\":\"123456\",\"message\":\"Hello World\"}"))
				.andExpect(status().isOk())
				.andDo(verify().jsonPath("$.id")
                        .stub("resource"));
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>This contract specifies that any valid POST with an "id" field receives the response
defined in this test. You can chain together calls to <literal>.jsonPath()</literal> to add additional
matchers. If JSON Path is unfamiliar, The <link xl:href="https://github.com/jayway/JsonPath">JayWay
documentation</link> can help you get up to speed.</simpara>
<simpara>Instead of the <literal>jsonPath</literal> and <literal>contentType</literal> convenience methods, you can also use the
WireMock APIs to verify that the request matches the created stub, as shown in the
following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Test
public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
	mockMvc.perform(post("/resource")
               .content("{\"id\":\"123456\",\"message\":\"Hello World\"}"))
			.andExpect(status().isOk())
			.andDo(verify()
					.wiremock(WireMock.post(
						urlPathEquals("/resource"))
						.withRequestBody(matchingJsonPath("$.id"))
                       .stub("post-resource"));
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The WireMock API is rich. You can match headers, query parameters, and request body by
regex as well as by JSON path. These features can be used to create stubs with a wider
range of parameters. The above example generates a stub resembling the following example:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>post-resource.json</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
  "request" : {
    "url" : "/resource",
    "method" : "POST",
    "bodyPatterns" : [ {
      "matchesJsonPath" : "$.id"
    }]
  },
  "response" : {
    "status" : 200,
    "body" : "Hello World",
    "headers" : {
      "X-Application-Context" : "application:-1",
      "Content-Type" : "text/plain"
    }
  }
}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<note>
<simpara>You can use either the <literal>wiremock()</literal> method or the <literal>jsonPath()</literal> and <literal>contentType()</literal>
methods to create request matchers, but you can&#8217;t use both approaches.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>On the consumer side, you can make the <literal>resource.json</literal> generated earlier in this section
available on the classpath (by
<link xl:href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html#_publishing_stubs_as_jars">publishing
stubs as JARs</link>, for example). After that, you can create a stub using WireMock in a
number of different ways, including by using
<literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock(stubs="classpath:resource.json")</literal>, as described earlier in this
document.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_generating_contracts_by_using_rest_docs">
<title>Generating Contracts by Using REST Docs</title>
<simpara>You can also generate Spring Cloud Contract DSL files and documentation with Spring REST
Docs. If you do so in combination with Spring Cloud WireMock, you get both the contracts
and the stubs.</simpara>
<simpara>Why would you want to use this feature? Some people in the community asked questions
about a situation in which they would like to move to DSL-based contract definition,
but they already have a lot of Spring MVC tests. Using this feature lets you generate
the contract files that you can later modify and move to folders (defined in your
configuration) so that the plugin finds them.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>You might wonder why this functionality is in the WireMock module. The functionality
is there because it makes sense to generate both the contracts and the stubs.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>Consider the following test:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">		this.mockMvc.perform(post("/foo")
					.accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_PDF)
					.accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
					.contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
					.content("{\"foo\": 23, \"bar\" : \"baz\" }"))
				.andExpect(status().isOk())
				.andExpect(content().string("bar"))
				// first WireMock
				.andDo(WireMockRestDocs.verify()
						.jsonPath("$[?(@.foo &gt;= 20)]")
						.jsonPath("$[?(@.bar in ['baz','bazz','bazzz'])]")
						.contentType(MediaType.valueOf("application/json"))
						.stub("shouldGrantABeerIfOldEnough"))
				// then Contract DSL documentation
				.andDo(document("index", SpringCloudContractRestDocs.dslContract()));</programlisting>
<simpara>The preceding test creates the stub presented in the previous section, generating both
the contract and a documentation file.</simpara>
<simpara>The contract is called <literal>index.groovy</literal> and might look like the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">import org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract

Contract.make {
    request {
        method 'POST'
        url '/foo'
        body('''
            {"foo": 23 }
        ''')
        headers {
            header('''Accept''', '''application/json''')
            header('''Content-Type''', '''application/json''')
        }
    }
    response {
        status 200
        body('''
        bar
        ''')
        headers {
            header('''Content-Type''', '''application/json;charset=UTF-8''')
            header('''Content-Length''', '''3''')
        }
        testMatchers {
            jsonPath('$[?(@.foo &gt;= 20)]', byType())
        }
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The generated document (formatted in Asciidoc in this case) contains a formatted
contract. The location of this file would be <literal>index/dsl-contract.adoc</literal>.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_new_structure_of_generated_stubs">
<title>New structure of generated stubs</title>
<simpara>In <literal>1.1.x</literal> we have introduced a change to the structure of generated stubs. If you have
been using the  <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal> notation to use the stubs from the classpath,
it no longer works. The following example shows how the <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal> notation
used to work:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@AutoConfigureWireMock(stubs = "classpath:/customer-stubs/mappings", port = 8084)</programlisting>
<simpara>You must either change the location of the stubs to:
<literal>classpath:&#8230;&#8203;/META-INF/groupId/artifactId/version/mappings</literal> or use the new
classpath-based <literal>@AutoConfigureStubRunner</literal>, as shown in the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@AutoConfigureWireMock(stubs = "classpath:customer-stubs/META-INF/travel.components/customer-contract/1.0.2-SNAPSHOT/mappings/", port = 8084)</programlisting>
<simpara>If you do not want to use <literal>@AutoConfigureStubRunner</literal> and you want to remain with the old
structure, set your plugin tasks accordingly. The following example would work for the
structure presented in the previous snippet.</simpara>

<simpara>Spring Cloud Vault Config provides client-side support for externalized configuration in a distributed system. With <link xl:href="https://www.vaultproject.io">HashiCorp&#8217;s Vault</link> you have a central place to manage external secret properties for applications across all environments. Vault can manage static and dynamic secrets such as username/password for remote applications/resources and provide credentials for external services such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Apache Cassandra, MongoDB, Consul, AWS and more.</simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara><literal>wget</literal>, <literal>openssl</literal> and <literal>unzip</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>at least Java 7 and a properly configured <literal>JAVA_HOME</literal> environment variable</simpara>

<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ src/test/bash/create_certificates.sh</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara><literal>create_certificates.sh</literal> creates certificates in <literal>work/ca</literal> and a JKS truststore <literal>work/keystore.jks</literal>. If you want to run Spring Cloud Vault using this quickstart guide you need to configure the truststore the <literal>spring.cloud.vault.ssl.trust-store</literal> property to <literal>file:work/keystore.jks</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara xml:id="quickstart.vault.start"><emphasis role="strong">Start Vault server</emphasis></simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ src/test/bash/local_run_vault.sh</programlisting>
<simpara>Vault is started listening on <literal>0.0.0.0:8200</literal> using the <literal>inmem</literal> storage and
<literal>https</literal>.
Vault is sealed and not initialized when starting up.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>If you want to run tests, leave Vault uninitialized. The tests will
initialize Vault and create a root token <literal>00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>If you want to use Vault for your application or give it a try then you need to initialize it first.</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ export VAULT_ADDR="https://localhost:8200"
$ export VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY=true # Don't do this for production
$ vault init</programlisting>
<simpara>You should see something like:</simpara>

Initial Root Token: 19aefa97-cccc-bbbb-aaaa-225940e63d76

Vault initialized with 5 keys and a key threshold of 3. Please
securely distribute the above keys. When the Vault is re-sealed,
restarted, or stopped, you must provide at least 3 of these keys
to unseal it again.

Vault does not store the master key. Without at least 3 keys,
your Vault will remain permanently sealed.</programlisting>
<simpara>Vault will initialize and return a set of unsealing keys and the root token.
Pick 3 keys and unseal Vault. Store the Vault token in the <literal>VAULT_TOKEN</literal>
 environment variable.</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ vault unseal (Key 1)

<simpara>Spring Cloud Vault accesses different resources. By default, the secret
backend is enabled which accesses secret config settings via JSON endpoints.</simpara>
<simpara>The HTTP service has resources in the form:</simpara>
<screen>/secret/{application}/{profile}
/secret/{application}
/secret/{defaultContext}/{profile}
/secret/{defaultContext}</screen>
<simpara>where the "application" is injected as the <literal>spring.application.name</literal> in the
<literal>SpringApplication</literal> (i.e. what is normally "application" in a regular
Spring Boot app), "profile" is an active profile (or comma-separated
list of properties). Properties retrieved from Vault will be used "as-is"
without further prefixing of the property names.</simpara>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_client_side_usage_2">
<title>Client Side Usage</title>
<simpara>To use these features in an application, just build it as a Spring
Boot application that depends on <literal>spring-cloud-vault-config</literal> (e.g. see
the test cases). Example Maven configuration:</simpara>
<example>
<title>pom.xml</title>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;parent&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-parent&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.5.4.RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;relativePath /&gt; &lt;!-- lookup parent from repository --&gt;
&lt;/parent&gt;

&lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-starter-vault-config&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;Edgware.SR2&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-test&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;/dependencies&gt;

&lt;build&gt;
    &lt;plugins&gt;
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;/plugin&gt;
    &lt;/plugins&gt;
&lt;/build&gt;

&lt;!-- repositories also needed for snapshots and milestones --&gt;</programlisting>
</example>
<simpara>Then you can create a standard Spring Boot application, like this simple HTTP server:</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class Application {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<simpara>When it runs it will pick up the external configuration from the
default local Vault server on port <literal>8200</literal> if it is running. To modify
the startup behavior you can change the location of the Vault server
using <literal>bootstrap.properties</literal> (like <literal>application.properties</literal> but for
the bootstrap phase of an application context), e.g.</simpara>
<example>
<title>bootstrap.yml</title>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.cloud.vault:
    host: localhost
    port: 8200
    scheme: https
    uri: https://localhost:8200
    connection-timeout: 5000
    read-timeout: 15000
    config:
        order: -10</programlisting>
</example>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>host</literal> sets the hostname of the Vault host. The host name will be used
for SSL certificate validation</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>port</literal> sets the Vault port</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>scheme</literal> setting the scheme to <literal>http</literal> will use plain HTTP.
Supported schemes are <literal>http</literal> and <literal>https</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>uri</literal> configure the Vault endpoint with an URI. Takes precedence over host/port/scheme configuration</simpara>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>config.order</literal> sets the order for the property source</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Enabling further integrations requires additional dependencies and
configuration. Depending on how you have set up Vault you might need
additional configuration like
<link xl:href="http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-vault/spring-cloud-vault.html#vault.config.ssl">SSL</link> and
<link xl:href="http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-vault/spring-cloud-vault.html#vault.config.authentication">authentication</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>If the application imports the <literal>spring-boot-starter-actuator</literal> project, the
status of the vault server will be available via the <literal>/health</literal> endpoint.</simpara>
<simpara>The vault health indicator can be enabled or disabled through the
property <literal>health.vault.enabled</literal> (default <literal>true</literal>).</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="vault.config.authentication">
<title>Authentication methods</title>
<simpara>Different organizations have different requirements for security
and authentication. Vault reflects that need by shipping multiple authentication
methods. Spring Cloud Vault supports token and AppId authentication.</simpara>
<section xml:id="vault.config.authentication.token">
<title>Token authentication</title>
<simpara>Tokens are the core method for authentication within Vault.
Token authentication requires a static token to be provided using the

<note>
<simpara>Token authentication is the default authentication method.
If a token is disclosed an unintended party gains access to Vault and
can access secrets for the intended client.</simpara>

<section xml:id="vault.config.authentication.appid">
<title>AppId authentication</title>
<simpara>Vault supports <link xl:href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/app-id.html">AppId</link>
authentication that consists of two hard to guess tokens. The AppId
defaults to <literal>spring.application.name</literal> that is statically configured.
The second token is the UserId which is a part determined by the application,
usually related to the runtime environment. IP address, Mac address or a
Docker container name are good examples. Spring Cloud Vault Config supports
IP address, Mac address and static UserId&#8217;s (e.g. supplied via System properties).
The IP and Mac address are represented as Hex-encoded SHA256 hash.</simpara>
<simpara>IP address-based UserId&#8217;s use the local host&#8217;s IP address.</simpara>
<example>
<title>bootstrap.yml using SHA256 IP-Address UserId&#8217;s</title>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.cloud.vault:
    authentication: APPID
    app-id:

<literal>MAC_ADDRESS</literal> or a class name implementing a custom <literal>AppIdUserIdMechanism</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The corresponding command to generate the IP address UserId from a command line is:</simpara>
<screen>$ echo -n 192.168.99.1 | sha256sum</screen>
<note>
<simpara>Including the line break of <literal>echo</literal> leads to a different hash value
so make sure to include the <literal>-n</literal> flag.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Mac address-based UserId&#8217;s obtain their network device from the
localhost-bound device. The configuration also allows specifying
a <literal>network-interface</literal> hint to pick the right device. The value of
<literal>network-interface</literal> is optional and can be either an interface
name or interface index (0-based).</simpara>
<example>

<simpara>The Mac address is specified uppercase and without colons.
Including the line break of <literal>echo</literal> leads to a different hash value
so make sure to include the <literal>-n</literal> flag.</simpara>
</note>
<section xml:id="_custom_userid">
<title>Custom UserId</title>
<simpara>The UserId generation is an open mechanism. You can set
<literal>spring.cloud.vault.app-id.user-id</literal> to any string and the configured
value will be used as static UserId.</simpara>
<simpara>A more advanced approach lets you set <literal>spring.cloud.vault.app-id.user-id</literal> to a
classname. This class must be on your classpath and must implement
the <literal>org.springframework.cloud.vault.AppIdUserIdMechanism</literal> interface
and the <literal>createUserId</literal> method. Spring Cloud Vault will obtain the UserId
by calling <literal>createUserId</literal> each time it authenticates using AppId to
obtain a token.</simpara>
<example>
<title>bootstrap.yml</title>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.cloud.vault:

<title>AWS-EC2 authentication</title>
<simpara>The <link xl:href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws-ec2.html">aws-ec2</link>
auth backend provides a secure introduction mechanism
for AWS EC2 instances, allowing automated retrieval of a Vault
token. Unlike most Vault authentication backends, this backend
does not require first-deploying, or provisioning security-sensitive
credentials (tokens, username/password, client certificates, etc.).
Instead, it treats AWS as a Trusted Third Party and uses the
cryptographically signed dynamic metadata information that uniquely
represents each EC2 instance.</simpara>
<example>
<title>bootstrap.yml using AWS-EC2 Authentication</title>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.cloud.vault:
    authentication: AWS_EC2</programlisting>
</example>
<simpara>AWS-EC2 authentication enables nonce by default to follow
the Trust On First Use (TOFU) principle. Any unintended party that
gains access to the PKCS#7 identity metadata can authenticate
against Vault.</simpara>
<simpara>During the first login, Spring Cloud Vault generates a nonce
that is stored in the auth backend aside the instance Id.
Re-authentication requires the same nonce to be sent. Any other
party does not have the nonce and can raise an alert in Vault for
further investigation.</simpara>
<simpara>The nonce is kept in memory and is lost during application restart.
You can configure a static nonce with <literal>spring.cloud.vault.aws-ec2.nonce</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>AWS-EC2 authentication roles are optional and default to the AMI.
You can configure the authentication role by setting the
<literal>spring.cloud.vault.aws-ec2.role</literal> property.</simpara>

<title>AWS-IAM authentication</title>
<simpara>The <link xl:href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws-ec2.html">aws</link> backend provides a secure
authentication mechanism for AWS IAM roles, allowing the automatic authentication with
vault based on the current IAM role of the running application.
 Unlike most Vault authentication backends, this backend
does not require first-deploying, or provisioning security-sensitive
credentials (tokens, username/password, client certificates, etc.).
Instead, it treats AWS as a Trusted Third Party and uses the
4 pieces of information signed by the caller with their IAM credentials
 to verify that the caller is indeed using that IAM role.</simpara>
<simpara>The current IAM role the application is running in is automatically calculated.
If you are running your application on AWS ECS then the application
will use the IAM role assigned to the ECS task of the running container.

<title>Generic Backend</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Vault supports at the basic level the generic secret
backend. The generic secret backend allows storage of arbitrary
values as key-value store. A single context can store one or many
key-value tuples. Contexts can be organized hierarchically.
Spring Cloud Vault allows using the Application name
and a default context name (<literal>application</literal>) in combination with active
profiles.</simpara>
<screen>/secret/{application}/{profile}
/secret/{application}
/secret/{default-context}/{profile}
/secret/{default-context}</screen>
<simpara>The application name is determined by the properties:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>spring.cloud.vault.generic.application-name</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>spring.cloud.vault.application-name</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>spring.application.name</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Secrets can be obtained from other folders within the generic backend by adding their
paths to the application name, separated by commas. For example, given the application
name <literal>usefulapp,mysql1,projectx/aws</literal>, each of these folders will be used:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>/secret/usefulapp</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>/secret/mysql1</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>/secret/projectx/aws</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Vault adds all active profiles to the list of possible context paths.
No active profiles will skip accessing contexts with a profile name.</simpara>
<simpara>Properties are exposed like they are stored (i.e. without additional prefixes).</simpara>

<simpara>Vault supports several database secret backends to generate database

services that need to access a database no longer need to configure
credentials: they can request them from Vault, and use Vault&#8217;s leasing
mechanism to more easily roll keys.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="vault.config.backends.configurer">
<title>Configure <literal>PropertySourceLocator</literal> behavior</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Vault uses property-based configuration to create <literal>PropertySource</literal>s
for generic and discovered secret backends.</simpara>
<simpara>Discovered backends provide <literal>VaultSecretBackendDescriptor</literal> beans to describe the configuration
state to use secret backend as <literal>PropertySource</literal>. A <literal>SecretBackendMetadataFactory</literal> is required
to create a <literal>SecretBackendMetadata</literal> object which contains path, name and property transformation
configuration.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>SecretBackendMetadata</literal> is used to back a particular <literal>PropertySource</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>You can register an arbitrary number of beans implementing <literal>VaultConfigurer</literal> for customization.
Default generic and discovered backend registration is disabled if Spring Cloud Vault discovers
at least one <literal>VaultConfigurer</literal> bean. You can however enable default registration with
<literal>SecretBackendConfigurer.registerDefaultGenericSecretBackends()</literal> and <literal>SecretBackendConfigurer.registerDefaultDiscoveredSecretBackends()</literal>.</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">public class CustomizationBean implements VaultConfigurer {

    @Override
    public void addSecretBackends(SecretBackendConfigurer configurer) {

        configurer.add("secret/my-application");

        configurer.registerDefaultGenericSecretBackends(false);
        configurer.registerDefaultDiscoveredSecretBackends(true);
    }
}</programlisting>
</informalexample>
<note>
<simpara>All customization is required to happen in the bootstrap context. Add your configuration
classes to <literal>META-INF/spring.factories</literal> at <literal>org.springframework.cloud.bootstrap.BootstrapConfiguration</literal>
in your application.</simpara>
</note>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="_service_registry_configuration">
<title>Service Registry Configuration</title>
<simpara>You can use a <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> (such as from Spring Cloud Consul) to locate
a Vault server by setting spring.cloud.vault.discovery.enabled=true (default <literal>false</literal>).
The net result of that is that your apps need a bootstrap.yml (or an environment variable)
with the appropriate discovery configuration.
The benefit is that the Vault can change its co-ordinates, as long as the discovery service
is a fixed point. The default service id is <literal>vault</literal> but you can change that on the client with
<literal>spring.cloud.vault.discovery.serviceId</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>The discovery client implementations all support some kind of metadata map
(e.g. for Eureka we have eureka.instance.metadataMap). Some additional properties of the service
may need to be configured in its service registration metadata so that clients can connect
correctly. Service registries that do not provide details about transport layer security
need to provide a <literal>scheme</literal> metadata entry to be set either to <literal>https</literal> or <literal>http</literal>.
If no scheme is configured and the service is not exposed as secure service, then
configuration defaults to <literal>spring.cloud.vault.scheme</literal> which is <literal>https</literal> when it&#8217;s not set.</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.cloud.vault.discovery:
    enabled: true
    service-id: my-vault-service</programlisting>
</informalexample>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="vault.config.fail-fast">
<title>Vault Client Fail Fast</title>
<simpara>In some cases, it may be desirable to fail startup of a service if
it cannot connect to the Vault Server.  If this is the desired
behavior, set the bootstrap configuration property
<literal>spring.cloud.vault.fail-fast=true</literal> and the client will halt with
an Exception.</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.cloud.vault:

<chapter xml:id="vault.config.ssl">
<title>Vault Client SSL configuration</title>
<simpara>SSL can be configured declaratively by setting various properties.
You can set either <literal>javax.net.ssl.trustStore</literal> to configure
JVM-wide SSL settings or <literal>spring.cloud.vault.ssl.trust-store</literal>
to set SSL settings only for Spring Cloud Vault Config.</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.cloud.vault:

<simpara>Please note that configuring <literal>spring.cloud.vault.ssl.*</literal> can be only
applied when either Apache Http Components or the OkHttp client
is on your class-path.</simpara>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="vault-lease-renewal">
<title>Lease lifecycle management (renewal and revocation)</title>
<simpara>With every secret, Vault creates a lease:
metadata containing information such as a time duration,
renewability, and more.</simpara>
<simpara>Vault promises that the data will be valid for the given duration,
or Time To Live (TTL). Once the lease is expired, Vault can
revoke the data, and the consumer of the secret can no longer
be certain that it is valid.</simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Vault maintains a lease lifecycle beyond
the creation of login tokens and secrets. That said,
login tokens and secrets associated with a lease
are scheduled for renewal just before the lease expires
until terminal expiry.
Application shutdown revokes obtained login tokens and renewable
leases.</simpara>
<simpara>Secret service and database backends (such as MongoDB or MySQL)
usually generate a renewable lease so generated credentials will
be disabled on application shutdown.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Static tokens are not renewed or revoked.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Lease renewal and revocation is enabled by default and can
be disabled by setting <literal>spring.cloud.vault.config.lifecycle.enabled</literal>
to <literal>false</literal>. This is not recommended as leases can expire and
Spring Cloud Vault cannot longer access Vault or services
using generated credentials and valid credentials remain active
after application shutdown.</simpara>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="yaml" linenumbering="unnumbered">spring.cloud.vault:
    config.lifecycle.enabled: true</programlisting>

 makes the number of distinct URIs less. For example, one can query for the same
 resource, regardless of signing parameters encoded in the query line. This does
 not reduce cardinality to a HTTP single route. For example, it is common to
 express a route as an http URI template like "/resource/{resource_id}". In
 systems where only equals queries are available, searching for
 {@code http.uri=/resource} won&#8217;t match if the actual request was
 "/resource/abcd-ff". Historical note: This was commonly expressed as "http.uri"
 in zipkin, eventhough it was most often just a path.</simpara></entry>
